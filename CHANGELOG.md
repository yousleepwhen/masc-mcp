# Changelog


## [0.9.10] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **OAS pin floor `0.153.0` → `0.155.0`** — picks up the event system
  cleanup from OAS v0.154.0 (removed `Event_bus.TaskStateChanged`,
  renamed Custom durable namespace `durable:*` → `durable.*`, stripped
  redundant `"custom."` prefix in `event_forward`) plus the verification
  tests / examples shipped in v0.155.0.
- **`lib/oas_sse_bridge.ml`** — removed the `TaskStateChanged` arm
  (variant was deleted upstream) and added SSE relay payloads for the
  three new native variants: `AgentFailed` (`agent_failed` event),
  `HandoffRequested` (`handoff_requested`), `HandoffCompleted`
  (`handoff_completed`). Carries full payload (error message, from/to
  agent, reason, elapsed) so downstream SSE consumers don't have to
  parse the OAS envelope.
- **`lib/verifier_oas.ml`** — extended the hook match on
  `Agent_sdk.Hooks.hook_event` to include the new
  `OnContextCompacted` variant (no-op `Continue`; verifier only cares
  about `PreToolUse`).

No behavioural changes beyond the new-variant passthrough in
`oas_sse_bridge.ml`. The full MASC-side event-boundary migration
(masc_events_bus split for `masc:*` publishes, hook-based
`keeper_compact_audit`, `correlation_id` plumbing) is still tracked as
a separate follow-up and is NOT part of this PR.

## [0.9.9] - 2026-04-17

### Changed

- **README facts aligned with code (PR #7730).**
  - OAS pin floor in badge + Tech Stack: `0.118.2` → `0.153.0` (matches `masc_mcp.opam` and `dune-project`).
  - Keeper lifecycle diagram corrected from "11-state" to the actual **12 states** in `lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.mli` (`Overflowed` was missing).
  - WebRTC signaling endpoints made precise: `POST /webrtc/offer`, `POST /webrtc/answer`, gated by `Server_webrtc_transport.is_enabled`.
  - Personal-project disclaimer added (Korean + English) at the top.
  - "Production surface" framing replaced with surface-map vocabulary that doesn't imply external SLA.
- **Root scratch removed (PR #7744).**
  - `git rm` on 9 tracked one-off files: `pr-payload.json`, `pr6975.json`, `pr_body_tmp.txt`, `test-integration-{retry,verify}.txt`, `test_portal_lock_stress.ml` (no rg refs in `lib/bin/test/scripts`), `EIO_REFACTOR_ISSUES.md`, `AGENTS.md` (CLAUDE.md is the live SSOT), `session_tracker_qa_tests.md`.
  - `.gitignore` extended with `pr-*.json`, `pr_body_*.txt`, `test-integration-*.txt` so future drops are ignored automatically.
- **Audit tracker added (PR #7749).** `docs/_audit/2026-04-17-doc-classification.md` classifies all 145 markdown files in `docs/` into A·Live (81) / B·Historical (46) / C·Hype (7) / D·Duplicate (11), with grep evidence and disposition per file. Tracker only — actual delete / archive / merge / frontmatter PRs are sequenced separately.

No code changes. Bump captures the documentation/hygiene cycle as a tagged release boundary.

## [0.9.8] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **OAS pin bump to `v0.153.0`** — picks up OAS PR #975
  (`Budget_strategy.default_summarizer` exported in the `.mli`).
- **`keeper_summarizer.ml` simplified** — deletes the local
  `default_extractive_summary` re-implementation and delegates to
  `Agent_sdk.Budget_strategy.default_summarizer` directly. This was
  the follow-up promised in PR #7668 (Gen4 compaction-layer [STATE]
  scrub). Net diff: −36 lines; behavior unchanged (4 existing tests
  in `test_keeper_summarizer.ml` still pass).
- `scripts/oas-agent-sdk-pin.sh` BASE/SHA/MIN → `v0.153.0` /
  `485ac29af8c14942e29c99381a9946c7000a55c9` / `0.153.0`.

## [0.9.7] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **OAS pin bump to `v0.152.0`** — raises the `agent_sdk` floor in
  `dune-project` and updates the helper constants in
  `scripts/oas-agent-sdk-pin.sh` (BASE_VERSION, SHA, MIN_VERSION) to
  `d5d92f38f6490b924238b5a176a9feb6e79d17e3`.
  - Picks up OAS PR #973 (`Agent.options.summarizer` +
    `Builder.with_summarizer`): downstream consumers can now inject a
    custom summarizer callback into `Budget_strategy.reduce_for_budget`
    via the options record instead of falling through to
    `default_summarizer`.
  - Also picks up OAS PR #962 (Anthropic `cache_extended_ttl`), included
    transitively via the 0.151.0 release.
  - No runtime behavior change in masc-mcp itself: this is a pin-only
    bump. Registering a `[STATE]`-aware summarizer is the follow-up step
    and ships separately.

## [0.9.6] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **Keeper continuity resonance loop** (PR #7612, #7615, #7618) — closes the
  save/read asymmetry that caused keepers to echo their own prior `[STATE]`
  narrative every turn.
  - `keeper_world_observation.ml:read_continuity_summary` now prefers the
    structured snapshot stored in `Checkpoint.working_context` over
    re-parsing `[STATE]` blocks from message bodies (PR #7612). Completes
    the RFC-MASC-001 Phase 1 read side; the save side already wrote
    structured JSON when enabled.
  - `scripts/retro-clean-keeper-continuity.sh` one-shot: dry-run default,
    `--apply` backs up and zeroes stale `continuity_summary` fields across
    `.masc/keepers/*.json`. Preserves all other fields (PR #7615).

### Changed
- **`MASC_STRUCTURED_STATE` default flipped to `true`** (PR #7618) —
  completes RFC-MASC-001 Phase 1 rollout. The structured
  `Checkpoint.working_context` save path is now active by default;
  combined with PR #7612 every keeper turn writes a typed snapshot and
  reads it back on the next turn instead of re-parsing `[STATE]` text.
  Accepted opt-out values: `false`, `0`, `no`. Legacy text `[STATE]`
  fallback is preserved for checkpoints without `working_context`.

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **CDAL Verdict Gate** (PR #7531, env `MASC_CDAL_GATE_ENABLED`, default off) —
  `cdal_verdict_gate.ml` blocks task completion when CDAL verdict is Violated
  or Inconclusive with blocking gaps. Reads persisted verdicts with task_id
  filtering via typed `persisted_verdict` envelope.
- **Task verification FSM** (PR #7531, env `MASC_VERIFICATION_FSM_ENABLED`,
  default off) — new `AwaitingVerification` task_status + 3 actions
  (`submit_for_verification`, `approve`, `reject`). Cross-agent enforcement
  (worker ≠ verifier). Contract-driven deadline and required role.
- **Verification protocol** (`verification_protocol.ml`) — board post + SSE
  event emission on submit/approve/reject/timeout. Updates
  `Verification.ml` state machine on cross-agent verdicts.
- **Keeper-as-verifier** — `pending_verification_count` in
  `world_observation`; keepers can observe and act on verification requests
  via `masc_transition(action=approve|reject)`.
- **Typed evidence criterion** — `Types_core.evidence_criterion` ADT
  (Schema_match/Contains/Not_contains/Custom) replaces string list for
  `task_contract.verify_gate_evidence`. Backward compat reader.
- **Env-configurable knobs** —
  `MASC_CDAL_VERDICT_LOOKUP_LIMIT` (default 500),
  `MASC_VERIFICATION_TIMEOUT_CHECK_INTERVAL_SEC` (default 60.0).

### Changed
- verification_id now cryptographically random (128-bit CSPRNG via
  mirage-crypto). Previously used `Hashtbl.hash` + timestamp (weak).
- Dashboard shows `검증 대기` badge for `awaiting_verification` status
  (accent color, event icons).

### Deprecated
- Legacy `_task_id` string-prefix JSONL envelope still read but no longer
  written. Reader handles both formats.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed (specs)

- **`KeeperContextLifecycle.tla` completeness pass** — closes 3 of the
  gaps flagged by the 2026-04-16 compaction FSM/TLA+ audit
  (#7568 §1.4):
  - `CompactionFailed(k)` action added (documentation-only in the
    clean `Next` to avoid infinite retry without a bounded retry
    variable; exercised by `NextBuggy`). Models the
    `Compaction_failed` event at `keeper_state_machine.ml:383-389`
    that routes `compacting → overflow_retry` without clearing
    `context_overflow`.
  - `CompactionCompletesBuggy(k)` + `NextBuggy` + `SpecBuggy` —
    new Bug Model variant that reallocates `context_id` during
    compaction (models a broken Context.t identity path).
  - `CheckpointConsistency` strengthened: previously a duplicate of
    `TurnMonotonicity` (`ckpt_turn <= turn + 1`); now verifies that
    `ckpt_ctx_id` references an allocated context_id
    (`0 < ckpt_ctx_id < next_ctx_id`). Strengthens formally-verified
    surface without weakening the turn-monotonicity check.

### Added (specs)

- `KeeperContextLifecycle-buggy.cfg` — Bug Model cfg that runs the
  deliberate `CompactionCompletesBuggy` variant. TLC finds
  `Invariant ResumeIdentity is violated` at 377 states / depth 6 /
  1s. Completes the Bug Model pattern coverage that was missing.
- `KeeperContextLifecycle-ci.cfg` — smaller-constant cfg for quick
  invariant validation in every CI build. Reserves the default cfg
  (5.6M+ states) for nightly/release runs. Liveness
  (`PROPERTIES`) intentionally omitted — see file header comment.

### Follow-ups (out of scope)

- Add a bounded retry-budget variable to model the
  `compact_retry_exhausted` latch → `Paused` routing, then include
  `CompactionFailed(k)` in the clean `Next` and re-add liveness to
  `KeeperContextLifecycle-ci.cfg`.
- Upgrade `TurnSucceeds` fairness from WF to SF so small-model
  liveness holds without growing the state space (exposed by
  `KeeperContextLifecycle-ci.cfg` during this work).

## [0.9.5] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Keeper compaction audit** (`lib/keeper/keeper_compact_audit.{ml,mli}`).
  New Event_bus subscriber that observes `ContextCompactStarted` and
  `ContextCompacted` payloads emitted by OAS, synthesises a per-keeper
  `compaction_id` to correlate Start/Complete pairs, and appends
  structured JSONL rows to `.masc/data/harness-compact/YYYY-MM/DD.jsonl`.
  Rolling retention (default 14 days, override via
  `MASC_COMPACTION_AUDIT_RETENTION_DAYS`) prunes old day-files on every
  write — self-healing, no cron. No OAS changes required; subscriber
  runs alongside existing `oas_sse_bridge` each on its own bounded
  stream.
- **Audit CLI** (`bin/masc_compaction_audit.ml`, installed as
  `masc-compaction-audit`). Options: `--since`, `--until`,
  `--keeper NAME`, `--orphans-only`, `--prune`, `--retention-days`.
  Pairs Start/Complete by `compaction_id`, emits human-readable summary,
  flags orphan rows (compaction that never completed, or server crash).
- **Compaction FSM/TLA+ audit** (`docs/audits/compaction-fsm-tla-audit-2026-04-16.md`,
  #7568). Traceability matrix for `KeeperContextLifecycle.tla` and
  `MemoryCompaction.tla` against 12-phase OCaml FSM. Confirms
  `Compaction_completed`/`Compaction_failed` handlers align with spec
  intent; reclassifies the `manual_reconcile_required` drift from prior
  audit as abstraction mismatch (live behaviour correct via PR #6834's
  separate event dispatch). Flags gaps: missing
  `KeeperContextLifecycle-buggy.cfg`, no `CompactionFailed` action in
  context spec, 3-of-5 gate abstractions.

## [0.9.4] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Runtime TOML config** for all 4 Python sidecars (#7509, #7518). Each
  sidecar reads an optional `$MASC_BASE_PATH/.gate/runtime/<kind>/config.toml`.
  File absent = field defaults only (zero-config works). Secrets stay in
  env vars. Priority: env > TOML > field default.
- **Shared bindings-store helpers** (`gate_shared/bindings_store.py`,
  #7501). `load_bindings` + `save_bindings` free functions replace 3x38
  duplicated lines across Slack/iMessage/Telegram sidecars.
- **Env-var aliases** for Slack + Telegram timeout/path config fields
  (#7506).
- **Cascade `weighted_entry.supports_tool_choice`** (#7493). Per-entry
  capability override parsed from cascade.json; `sangsu` profile's
  Ollama entry declares `"supports_tool_choice": true`.

### Changed

- **OAS pin bumped to v0.150.0** (#7493). Removes
  `OAS_OLLAMA_SUPPORTS_TOOL_CHOICE` env var in favor of per-config
  `Provider_config.supports_tool_choice_override`.
- **Code quality pass** (#7516): trimmed 56 LOC of excessive comments +
  fixed 3 TOCTOU `Sys.file_exists` pre-checks in `read_json_file_opt`.

### Fixed

- Keeper: redirect `gh` to keeper_shell op=gh (#7474), demote
  semaphore_wait logs to INFO (#7472), add admin tools to Keeper_denied
  surface (#7455), hand off after overflow retry (#7435), accept both
  `pr_number` and `number` in keeper_pr_review (#7476).
- CI: pin `ocaml/setup-ocaml` to avoid upstream opam-binary regression
  (#7499).
- Dashboard: activity_graph events_shown vs events_store_total (#7502).
- Coord: before-state snapshots in error path logging (#7512), unified
  transition log_event JSON (#7504), correlation_id/run_id on task
  activity (#7511).

## [0.9.3] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Gate wire vocabulary migrated** from `keeper_name` to `destination_id`
  across a 4-phase rolling deprecation. The Gate library is en route to a
  standalone `gate-mcp` repo (Track B4); `keeper_name` carried
  MASC-specific language that didn't belong in a generic gate contract.
  Phases:
  - Phase 1 (#7482): `inbound_of_json` accepts either key (prefers
    `destination_id`).
  - Phase 2 (#7484): `outbound_to_json` emits both keys.
  - Phase 2b (#7485): sidecar `GateResponse.from_json` parses either
    key on the consumer side (single shared helper covers all four
    Python sidecars).
  - Phase 3 (#7487): `outbound_to_json` drops `keeper_name`; only
    `destination_id` emitted now.
  - Phase 4 (future major release): rename internal OCaml record field
    and inbound-only `keeper_name` parse as well.

### Migration note

Out-of-tree consumers that still read only the `keeper_name` key from
gate reply JSON now see `null`. Upgrade to read `destination_id`. The
transition window was Phase 2 → Phase 3 (both keys emitted); consumers
had the full Phase 2 release to migrate.

## [0.9.2] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **B3c Python sidecar migration complete**. All four Python sidecars
  (`discord-bot`, `imessage-bot`, `slack-bot`, `telegram-bot`) now
  default to `.gate/runtime/<kind>/*` and share the same 1-tier legacy
  read-fallback pattern. Pre-v0.9.0 `bindings.json` auto-discovered on
  first startup; next save writes to the new default (#7477 iMessage,
  #7478 Slack, #7479 Telegram). Discord already migrated in v0.9.1.

### Fixed

- **OCaml bootstrap no longer depends on upstream latest-opam auto-pick**.
  On 2026-04-16 the latest stable `opam 2.5.1` release was published
  before Linux x86_64 binaries were attached, so `ocaml/setup-ocaml`
  failed early with `Failed to find opam binary for 'linux' and 'x86_64'`.
  The shared toolchain bootstrap now downloads the published `opam 2.5.0`
  Linux binary directly and `release.yml`, `webrtc-live-interop.yml`, and
  `deploy-railway.yml` reuse the same local bootstrap.
  Closes #7475.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-04-16

### Changed

- **Gate runtime path migration**: default storage paths move from
  `.masc/connectors/<kind>/*` to `.gate/runtime/<kind>/*` for Discord
  (OCaml + Python sidecar) and iMessage (OCaml). The pre-v0.9.0 layout is
  demoted to `legacy_*_path` so existing deployments see a transparent
  read-fallback — next write lands at the new default (#7467, #7468, #7470).
- iMessage's OCaml `configured_read_path` gained a required `~legacy`
  parameter, matching the Discord resolver in
  `Channel_gate_discord_names`. Read priority: env var > new default (if
  file exists) > legacy (if file exists) > new default (stable for later
  creation) (#7468).
- Discord sidecar cleanup: the `LEGACY_BASE_ROOT = Path("sidecars/discord-bot")`
  constant and `_resolve_legacy_storage_path` helper were removed. They
  served a 2026-Q1 cwd-relative layout (`sidecars/discord-bot/.gate/discord_*`)
  that is no longer auto-discovered; deployments still on it must set
  `DISCORD_*_PATH` env vars explicitly (#7470).

### Deferred to v0.9.2

- iMessage, Slack, Telegram sidecar migrations (Python). These sidecars
  currently have **no read-fallback loop** in their `bot.py` entry, unlike
  Discord. Each needs a 1-tier fallback wired in before the `DEFAULT_*` →
  `LEGACY_*` rotation can safely ship.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added

- **Dashboard UX**: density toggle (comfortable/compact) (#7377); Compound Graph
  toggle bound to `g` (#7398); tab anomaly indicator on selected keeper (#7383);
  manual refresh button + `r` shortcut (#7378); Watson-pattern inferred reason
  on transition trail (#7397); time-windowed observatory telemetry (#7390).
- **Keeper features**: social transition reasons exposed + cross-turn state
  (#7399, #7395); magentic ledger social model + TLA+ spec (#7426, #7430);
  campaign FSM harness (#7385); `sangsu` cascade profile — local-first Ollama +
  GLM fallback (#7404); pipe support in `masc_code_shell` (#7393).

### Changed

- **Discord connector dashboard is now keeper-first** (#7388). Each configured
  keeper has its own section with inline channel-binding management; bindings
  that reference a keeper not in the directory are surfaced under `⚠` instead
  of being silently dropped. Replaces the prior binding-first grouping that
  users reported as opaque across 5 distinct confusion points.
- **Gate library extraction**: pure Gate modules (`gate_protocol`,
  `channel_gate_connector`, `channel_gate_discord_*`, `channel_gate_imessage_*`,
  `channel_gate_metrics`, `gate_time_util`) moved to `lib/gate/` as the
  `masc_gate` sub-library (#7407 B1a). `channel_gate` facade joined the same
  sub-library after Pulse extraction (#7457 B1c). Call sites unchanged thanks
  to `wrapped false`. Prerequisite for the planned standalone `gate-mcp` repo.
- **Pulse library extraction** (#7452 B1b): the beat engine moved to
  `lib/pulse/` as the `masc_pulse` sub-library. Unblocks Gate's dependency on
  Pulse without routing the arrow back through `masc_mcp`.
- **OAS pin → v0.148.0** (from v0.141.0) (#7394 + prior pins). Legacy cascade
  API removed from OAS across v0.142.0–v0.148.0 — `Judge.judge` and
  `Tool_selector.default_rerank_fn` now take a single `Provider_config.t`, and
  `Cascade_executor` was deleted (839 LOC). Cascade orchestration is now
  entirely a MASC concern; `keeper_agent_run` resolves the cascade locally,
  picks the first healthy provider, and passes a single provider to the
  single-provider SDK. Falls back to `core+prefilter+discovered` on
  no-healthy-provider (same as before).
- **`Room` module retired** (#7355): split into `room_state.ml` + renamed
  remainder to `Coord`.
- **Hashtbl → immutable StringMap/StringSet** across 14+ modules: `exec_memory`
  (#7414 #7416), `memory_bank` (#7429), `memory_recall` (#7421), `hooks_oas`
  (#7428), `tool_diversity` (#7425), `types_profile` (#7423), `rate_limit`
  (#7420), `cancellation` (#7419), `supervisor` (#7409 #7410), `context_core`
  (#7418), `exec_shared` (#7417), `tool_policy` (#7359), `agent_identity`
  (#7422), `streamable_http session storage` (#7427).
- Stringly-typed internal variants replaced with typed sums (#7347).
- `fail_fast_enabled` → `startup_abort_eligible` rename (#7415).

### Fixed

- Dashboard: 50-task hard cap removed (#7432); legacy composite payload
  normalized (#7412); duplicate cache timeout WARN in bg-revalidate (#7446);
  repeat shell cache timeout on rooms with many board posts (#7402).
- Keeper: deduplicated tool_use_failure + cycle-failure WARN/ERROR
  (#7454, #7451); `gh` timeout floor + org allowlist in `validate_gh_command`
  (#7433); status tails sorted + continuity fallback marker (#7363); real-cause
  pointer when `rg` exits 2 (#7408).
- Log: normal keeper/JSON flows no longer WARN (#7444).
- Board: `masc_board_post` accepts `body` alias + auto-fills author (#7445);
  duplicate 100-post pagination cap removed (#7396).
- Checkpoint: malformed checkpoint detection logging in `load_latest` (#7413).

### Removed

- `keeper_pr_submit` tool + hardened `gh`/dashboard flows (#7389).
- 18 dead permission entries (#7434); dead tool references
  (`masc_release`, `swarm_start` variants) (#7376).
- Dead `Blocked` variant from `turn_outcome` (#7346).
- Dead functions from `keeper_status_bridge` (#7403, #7406).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-15

### Changed
- **Tool registry pruning** (#7184): removed 65 dead tools with zero
  usage in April 2026 tool_usage logs. Deleted 5 entire subsystems
  (verify_*, auth_*, repair_loop_*, handover_*, heartbeat internals)
  as 19 source files + ~7,700 lines. Also pruned individual dead
  handlers, schemas, permission entries, and dispatch arms for 25+
  system-internal tools (agent eval, error tracking, lock/unlock,
  cancellation, subscription, progress, feature_flags, init,
  governance_set, set_room, etc.). keeper_denied surface reduced to
  `masc_reset`, `masc_spawn` only. masc_heartbeat dispatch relocated
  from deleted tool_heartbeat.ml to tool_room.ml.

### Added
- Operator-facing context overflow recovery tools (#7115). Two new MCP
  tools paired with the `Overflowed` phase introduced in #7083:
  - `masc_keeper_compact`: dispatches `Operator_compact_requested` to the
    keeper FSM and runs checkpoint compaction via OAS
    `recover_latest_checkpoint_for_overflow_retry`. Phase precondition is
    `Overflowed`/`Paused`/`Compacting`; `force=true` bypasses for
    `Running`/`Failing`.
  - `masc_keeper_clear`: last-resort context wipe. Loads the checkpoint,
    clears non-system messages (system prompt preserved by default), saves
    a new checkpoint, dispatches `Operator_clear_requested`. Requires an
    operator-provided `reason` for audit trail.
- Prometheus counters for the new operator tools:
  `masc_keeper_operator_compact_total{keeper,result}` (result ∈
  `ok|no_checkpoint|precondition`) and
  `masc_keeper_operator_clear_total{keeper,preserve_system}`.
- `checkpoint_found` field in the `masc_keeper_clear` response so
  operators can distinguish "no messages to clear" from "no checkpoint
  on disk".

### Fixed
- `masc_keeper_compact`/`masc_keeper_clear` now read/write checkpoints
  from `session_base_dir(config)` (`<masc_root>/.masc/traces`) instead
  of the incorrect `<base_path>/<keeper_name>`. Previous path would have
  made the tools always report missing checkpoints.
- When no valid checkpoint exists, `masc_keeper_compact` now dispatches
  `Compaction_failed` rather than `Compaction_completed { 0, 0 }`. The
  latter was a false-success signal that would clear `context_overflow`
  even though no compaction happened.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Prometheus metrics dashboard surface under monitoring tab (#6974). Fetches
  `/metrics`, parses Prometheus text format, renders 8 categorized tables
  (Server, Agent, Keeper, Transport, Inference, Tool, Delta, Provider).
- Clickable links from Prometheus labels: `keeper=` labels navigate to
  keeper detail, `tool_name=` labels navigate to tool-quality with
  highlight-and-scroll of the matching row (#7017).
- Agent + Transport metric categories — recategorize `masc_agent_*`,
  `masc_grpc_*`, `masc_ws_*` that previously fell into Other (#7017).
- RFC-0003 Keeper Composite Lifecycle docs + TLA+ spec with buggy variants
  (cascade, compaction, recovery) for regression-style verification (#7020).

### Fixed
- UTF-8 sanitization on outbound telemetry writers. `keeper_tool_call_log`
  and `oas_sse_bridge` now scrub invalid UTF-8 before persisting or
  broadcasting, eliminating ~12% JSONL row drop when tool output contains
  truncated multi-byte sequences (#6929).
- Prometheus histogram export format. `to_prometheus_text()` now emits
  histograms as `summary` type with `_sum`/`_count` pair rather than the
  invalid `histogram` bare type, so Prometheus servers parse the metrics
  correctly (#6936).
- `tool_usage_log` syntax error at line 105 (`let counts = fold_left ...`
  missing `in`) that broke Build/Test, Health, and Lint CI (#6975).
  Complexity comment updated from O(1) to O(log n) to match StringSet.mem.

### Changed
- Concurrency hardening: serialize `keeper_recurring` tasks Hashtbl +
  atomic id counter (#7022), `sse event_buffer` Queue with Eio.Mutex
  (#7016), `tool_shard` agent_shards read-modify-write (#6985).
- Pin `agent_sdk` to 0.134.0 (#7012).
- CI `ci_core=true` no longer forces TLA+, saving ~14 min per run (#7024).
- Dashboard: remove unused config binding in `ordered_room_ids` (#7021).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- Dashboard OAS telemetry surface (#6978).
- `oas_sse_bridge` usage relay wiring (#6938).

### Changed
- Concurrency and observability fixes carried over from the 0.5.x line.

### Notes
- Version bumped in `dune-project` and `masc_mcp.opam` by #7009. This
  entry finalizes the release docs that were omitted in that bump, so
  `scripts/check-version-truth.sh` stops failing on every main-base PR.

## [0.5.11] - 2026-04-13

### Changed
- Replace all `Eio.traceln` in `lib/` with structured `Log` module
  calls (cascade_inference, autoresearch_codegen, dashboard judges,
  opentelemetry_client). Zero ad-hoc traceln calls remain.
- Add relay calibration drift metric: warn on correction_factor
  outside [0.5, 1.5], debug on shift > 0.1.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Changed
- Release SemVer restarts at `0.y.z` to reflect that `masc-mcp` is still pre-1.0.
- Release-train automation now compares tags within the active major series, so frozen legacy `v2.*` tags do not block the new `0.x` line.
- Front-door docs, release policy, and issue templates now point at `v0.2.0` as the active package version.
- The reset starts at `0.2.0` because historical `v0.1.0` and `v0.1.1` tags already exist in the repo.

### Deprecated
- New `v2.*` release tags. Historical `v2.87.0` through `v2.263.0` remain immutable legacy references.
