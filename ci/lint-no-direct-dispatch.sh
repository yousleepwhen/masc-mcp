# RFC-0084 §10 + PR-14 — CI lint: enforce single-entry dispatch surface.
#
# After PR-7 (keeper turn) / PR-8 (MCP server) / PR-9 (tag-dispatch
# fallback) migration and PR-11 mli surface removal, the public
# dispatch surface is `Tool_dispatch.guarded_dispatch` only. Both
# legacy entries (`Tool_dispatch.dispatch`, `Tool_dispatch.dispatch_structured`)
# remain in `tool_dispatch.ml` as private implementation details and
# are no longer reachable through the mli.
#
# This script fails CI if any file under `lib/` or `bin/` (excluding
# `lib/tool_dispatch.ml` itself) references the legacy entries — the
# pinned invariant from `test/test_dispatch_legacy_removed.ml`.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  : invariant holds (zero external callers of legacy entries)
#   1  : invariant broken (legacy caller introduced)
#
# Run locally:
#   bash ci/lint-no-direct-dispatch.sh
#
# RFC-0084 §10 verification matrix entry: `Tool_dispatch.dispatch`
# direct caller in lib/, bin/, test/ must be 0.

# tag-based dispatch (not handler-registry) and re-route pre-hook
# semantics inside the Tool_telemetry.with_span wrap (PR-8 PR body
# §"What this PR does NOT do"). Excluded from this lint by design;
# follow-up cleanup PR may inline pre-hook chain into guarded_dispatch.
