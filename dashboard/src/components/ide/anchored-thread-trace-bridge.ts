/**
 * RFC-0028 PR-δ producer: anchored-thread → keeper-trace bridge.
 *
 * Pure mapper — given a snapshot of anchored-thread posts and a set of
 * post ids that have already been emitted, push trace events for the
 * new ones and return the updated set.
 *
 * Why a pure function (not a stateful subscription):
 *   - The owning component (`IdeConversationRail`) already has the
 *     fetched `posts` array as a useState value. A pure mapper called
 *     from a `useEffect([posts])` is sufficient and trivially testable.
 *   - Avoids storing per-component state inside the trace store, which
 *     would couple the store to producer lifecycle.
 *   - Module-level mutable state would leak across components and break
 *     the deduplication guarantee on remount.
 *
 * Mapping (BoardPost → KeeperTraceEvent):
 *   id         ← post.id
 *   tsMs       ← Date.parse(post.created_at) (NaN-guarded)
 *   keeperName ← post.author_identity
 *   threadId   ← post.id (BoardPost is the thread itself for now)
 *   filePath   ← post.filePath when the caller has already resolved a safe
 *                board-thread file anchor; otherwise null
 *   line       ← post.line when the caller has already resolved a safe
 *                board-thread file anchor; otherwise null so consumers fall
 *                back to the keeper-level no-line bucket per RFC §5
 *
 * NaN-guard rationale: a malformed `created_at` would otherwise
 * propagate `NaN` into the store and break binary-search insertion. We
 * silently skip such posts — they cannot participate in replay either.
