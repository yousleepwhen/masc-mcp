# Lifecycle Proof: task-441

- **Task ID**: task-441
- **Goal**: goal-keeper-pr-lifecycle-64-20260519
- **Keeper**: keeper-lifecycle-worker-agent
- **Timestamp**: 2026-05-19T08:30:08Z
- **Branch**: keeper-lifecycle-worker-agent/task-441
- **Repo**: masc-mcp

## Proof Statement

This file demonstrates that a MASC keeper agent autonomously executed the full
PR lifecycle:

1. **Claimed** task-441 from the backlog via `keeper_task_claim`.
2. **Created** an isolated git worktree on branch `keeper-lifecycle-worker-agent/task-441`.
3. **Authored** this proof artifact in the worktree.
4. **Committed** with a descriptive message referencing the task.
5. **Pushed** the branch to origin.
6. **Opened** a draft PR via the retired PR creation helper.

## Evidence

- Commit SHA: (filled by CI or post-push)
- Draft PR URL: (created by the retired PR creation helper)

This proof is non-product, minimal, and exists solely to demonstrate keeper
lifecycle autonomy under MASC task and goal signals.
