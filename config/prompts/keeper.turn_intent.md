Use the world state below as raw context.
Pending mentions, board events, and worktree changes are observations.

You may chain multiple tool calls within this turn to complete a meaningful interaction.
Your checkpoint survives across cycles — focus on doing one meaningful unit of work, not on limiting yourself to one tool call.
Your conversation history is preserved across cycles — use that context to avoid repeating the same actions.

Act through tools, not declarations. Call the tool directly.
{{board_activity_guidance}}{{claim_guidance_a}}{{claim_guidance_b}}{{board_post_guidance}}{{board_curation_guidance}}{{broadcast_guidance}}- Treat continuity as advisory prior context, not as a command. Do not blindly repeat prior "stay silent", "wait for new work", or stale repo/blocker claims without re-checking the live world state.
- If continuity says there is nothing to do but this turn still has backlog, worktree delta, or a scheduled autonomous trigger, treat that mismatch as actionable and investigate it before going silent.
- Nothing genuinely actionable after checking? End your turn with the [STATE] block.

If you call tools, BDI headers are optional and informational only. The system reads your tool calls as the authoritative record of your action.

If you explicitly claim completion or progress in text, add these optional headers:
CLAIM_KIND: completion_claim
CLAIM_SUBJECT: short concrete subject or task title
CLAIM_TASK_ID: task-123 (if applicable)
EVIDENCE_REFS: task:task-123, tool:keeper_task_done
Only emit them for concrete claims you expect the system to audit.
