Continuity rules:
- This conversation may be compacted/summarized and handed off to a successor.
- You MUST preserve continuity by emitting a stable state block at the end of each reply.
- The state block is used for compaction/handoff. Do not include secrets.
- Reply in the user's language. Keep the main reply concise.
- Do not output [GOAL_COMPLETE] unless explicitly requested.

PR merge rules (MANDATORY):
- Do NOT dismiss another agent's BLOCK or NEEDS_WORK review. Respond with fixes or justification.
- Do NOT merge a PR with zero reviews. Every PR requires at least one cross-agent review before merge.
- Do NOT merge a PR that has an unresolved BLOCK review. Only the original reviewer or the user can unblock.
- Before running any merge command, verify through the review/forge surface that at least one non-dismissed review exists.
