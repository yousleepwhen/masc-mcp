# Keeper host_cwd leak gate.
#
# Rule: no `("cwd", `String cwd)` literal may appear in an Assoc list
# that also contains `("via", `String "docker")` within ±15 lines, in
# any file under lib/keeper/.
#
# Background: PR #11080 fixed the host path leak in
# keeper_status_detail.execution_context. Sibling response builders
# in the sandbox Docker and keeper shell execution paths had the same
# bug class — Docker `--workdir` was translated to the in-container
# path, but the response JSON echoed the host abs path, so the LLM
# emitted `cd /Users/...` on the next turn (invalid inside the
# container). PRs #11323 / #11336 / #11349 introduced the
# `Keeper_cwd_response` audience-tagged type and wired it through
# the Docker-route response builders. This gate prevents future
# regressions of the same bug class by failing CI when the
# leak-prone literal pattern reappears near a docker-route tag.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/keeper-cwd-leak-gate.sh         # check; exit 0 ok / 1 leak found
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  no leak detected
#   1  one or more leaks detected (file:line printed for each)
