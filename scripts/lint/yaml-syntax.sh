# Validate YAML syntax for every .github/workflows/*.yml.
#
# Why: 2026-05-05 PR #13042 added two `run: |` blocks to ci.yml that both
# contained the `\<newline>column-1-text` line-continuation pattern. PR
# #13050 fixed one of them (line 529-530) but missed the identical
# pattern in the env_knob_catalog gate (line 542-545) introduced in the
# same batch. main was a 30+ minute merge blocker until PR #13064
# collapsed the second occurrence. The miss happened because workflow
# files were not parsed at PR-time — invalid syntax silently fails the
# workflow run as "workflow-file-issue" rather than failing the PR.
#
# This script parses every workflow file with PyYAML, aggregates parse
# failures across all files, prints one ::error annotation per failing
# file, and exits non-zero if any file failed (i.e. it does not
# fail-fast — operators get the full list of broken files in a single
# CI run). Run as a PR check so the same partial-fix shape cannot
# reach main again.
#
# Dependency: PyYAML. The .github/workflows/fundamental-check.yml
# job that invokes this script installs it explicitly via
# `python -m pip install pyyaml` so the gate does not silently rely
# on whatever happens to be preinstalled on ubuntu-latest at the
# moment.
