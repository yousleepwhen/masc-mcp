(** Top-level router for the Bonsai island.

    Server serves the same HTML shell (see
    [lib/server/server_routes_http_pages.ml:bonsai_index_html]) at every
    [/dashboard/b/*] URL, so route selection happens client-side. Static
    read at mount time — no client-side history API yet.

    Route SSOT: [route.ml]. Add a tab = add a variant + extend helpers. *)
