# Legendary Bash Runbook

This runbook documents the operator surface of the "Legendary Bash" exec
rework — the P1–P6 upgrades to `keeper_bash` / `keeper_shell` — and the
procedure for interpreting dark-launch observer logs before flipping the
remaining defaults.

## Related Documents

- [`ENV-CONTRACT.md`](./ENV-CONTRACT.md) §4 — authoritative flag matrix
- [`BOOT-ENV-STATE-INVENTORY.md`](./BOOT-ENV-STATE-INVENTORY.md)
- `planning/graceful-panda/Legendary-Bash-plan.md` (source plan, 6 phases)

## Scope

- Covers: `keeper_bash`, `keeper_shell`, exec semantic exit, output
  truncation, background task lifecycle, AST safety gate, verification
  contract markers.
- Does not cover: the cascade verifier itself or the approval layer for
  MCP tools. Those are separate surfaces.

Every flag in this runbook is `request_dynamic` on the keeper-bash path:
operators can flip without a process restart and the next `keeper_bash`
call observes the new value.

## Current Rollout State

As of `last_verified`:

| Phase | Feature | Default | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | `semantic_exit` typed return code | **on** | flipped (post-PR soak) |
| P2 | background task lifecycle | n/a | delivered, opt-in per call |
| P3 | head+tail truncation | on | delivered |
| P4 | auto-background on blocking budget | off | **observer live** (`MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG_OBSERVE`) |
| P5 | AST-only single-gate safety | off | **observer live** (`MASC_BASH_AST_SHADOW_LOG`) |
| P6 | `verifiable_markers` emission | **on** | flipped (post-PR soak) |

Two dark-launch observers (P4 and P5) are the active operational surface
today. Every other Legendary flag is already on or opt-in per call.

## Flag Matrix (Quick Reference)

Authoritative definitions live in `ENV-CONTRACT.md §4`. Operator-facing
summary:

| Variable | Default | Opt-out tokens | What changes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MASC_BASH_SEMANTIC_EXIT` | on | `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` | drops `return_code_interpretation` JSON field |
| `MASC_BASH_OUTPUT_CAP` | on | — | head+tail truncation; `MASC_BASH_CAP_HEAD`/`TAIL` override per-stream caps |
| `MASC_BASH_VERIFIABLE_MARKERS` | on | `0`, `false`, `no`, `off` | drops typed `verifiable_markers` from `Cdal_judge` |
| `MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG` | off | — | foreground commands that outrun the blocking budget auto-promote |
| `MASC_BLOCKING_BUDGET_MS` | `15000` | — | consumed by `AUTO_BG` (promotion) and `AUTO_BG_OBSERVE` (would-have-promoted) |
| `MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG_OBSERVE` | off | — | dark-launch observer for P4 |
| `MASC_BASH_AST_ONLY` | off | — | replaces regex+AST dual-gate with AST-only |
| `MASC_BASH_AST_SHADOW_LOG` | off | — | dark-launch observer for P5 |

## Dark-Launch Observer: P5 Gate Shadow

### Purpose
Record every case where the legacy regex gate and the new AST gate would
disagree on a real `keeper_bash` call, without changing the execution
outcome.

### Enable

```bash
export MASC_BASH_AST_SHADOW_LOG=1
```

Inert if `MASC_BASH_AST_ONLY=1` (you are already running the target
state).

### Log line

```
gate_diff_shadow keeper=<name> cmd_hash=<12-hex-md5> diff=<tag> legacy=<tag> shadow=<tag>
```

Emitted only on non-`Agree` outcomes. `cmd_hash` is a 12-character MD5
prefix — the raw command is never logged.

### Diff tags

| Tag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `agree` | not logged (suppressed) |
| `shadow_stricter` | AST denies, regex allows — regressions if flipped today |
| `shadow_permissive` | AST allows, regex denies — potential win if flipped, audit manually |
| `parse_aborted` / `too_complex` | AST bailed out, regex still authoritative |

### Grep recipe

Aggregate one day of shadow logs:

```bash
grep gate_diff_shadow logs/keeper/*.log \
  | awk '{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++) if ($i ~ /^diff=/) print $i}' \
  | sort | uniq -c
```

### Flip criteria for `MASC_BASH_AST_ONLY`

All of the following must hold on a rolling 7-day window:

1. `shadow_stricter` count is `0` (any case is a real regression).
2. `parse_aborted` + `too_complex` is less than 1% of total
   `keeper_bash` calls (remaining AST gaps are tolerable).
3. N=1000+ prod calls observed (statistical power).

The flip covenant test `test_gate_diff.ml` must also still be green.

## Dark-Launch Observer: P4 Blocking Budget

### Purpose
Record every foreground `keeper_bash` call that would have auto-promoted
to a background task if `MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG` were on — without actually
promoting.

### Enable

```bash
export MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG_OBSERVE=1
```

Inert if `MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG=1` (you are already running the target
state). Also inert when the fiber has no `Eio` clock in scope, because
the observer only instruments the foreground path.

### Log line

```
auto_bg_would_have_promoted keeper=<name> cmd_hash=<12-hex-md5> duration_ms=<n> budget_ms=<m>
```

Emitted only when `duration_ms >= budget_ms`. Same `cmd_hash` convention
as P5.

### Grep recipe

```bash
grep auto_bg_would_have_promoted logs/keeper/*.log \
  | awk -F'duration_ms=' '{print $2}' \
  | awk '{print $1}' \
  | sort -n | tail -20
```

Tail gives the worst-case durations observed. Histogram by keeper:

```bash
grep auto_bg_would_have_promoted logs/keeper/*.log \
  | awk '{for (i=1;i<=NF;i++) if ($i ~ /^keeper=/) print $i}' \
  | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn
```

### Flip criteria for `MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG`

The default flip is a product decision, not a pure observability one —
the plan explicitly marks it as `Opt-in only` until cumulative data
justifies otherwise. Suggested gate:

1. 7-day prod sample of `auto_bg_would_have_promoted` hits.
2. Review which keepers dominate the distribution.
3. Confirm downstream consumers handle the
   `{promoted, background_task_id, partial_output}` response shape.
4. Stage via per-keeper override before global default flip.

`MASC_BLOCKING_BUDGET_MS` tuning can precede the flip. Raising it
reduces promotion frequency; lowering it accelerates it.

## In-process Snapshot Endpoint

Both observers also increment `Atomic.t` counters inside the process
while enabled. The cumulative totals are exposed as a single public-
read JSON endpoint for dashboards or flip-decision tooling that does
not want to scan the keeper log stream:

```
GET /api/v1/legendary_bash/shadow_counters
```

Response shape (field names mirror `Legendary_counters.snapshot` 1:1):

```json
{
  "gate_diff_total": 0,
  "gate_diff_agree": 0,
  "gate_diff_legacy_allow_shadow_deny": 0,
  "gate_diff_legacy_deny_shadow_allow": 0,
  "gate_diff_shadow_cannot_parse": 0,
  "auto_bg_observed": 0,
  "auto_bg_would_have_promoted": 0,
  "too_complex_redirect": 0,
  "too_complex_logic_op": 0,
  "too_complex_heredoc": 0,
  "too_complex_here_string": 0,
  "too_complex_cmd_subst": 0,
  "too_complex_proc_subst": 0,
  "too_complex_subshell": 0,
  "too_complex_arith_expansion": 0,
  "too_complex_control_flow": 0,
  "too_complex_function_def": 0,
  "too_complex_glob_brace": 0,
  "too_complex_background": 0,
  "too_complex_parse_error": 0,
  "too_complex_parse_aborted": 0,
  "too_complex_other": 0,
  "ratios": {
    "disagree_ratio": 0.0,
    "shadow_parse_coverage": 0.0,
    "auto_bg_promotion_rate": 0.0
  }
}
```

Every counter stays at `0` until the matching observer env flag is
set, so the endpoint itself is cost-free under default posture. The
`ratios` sibling surfaces the three flip-decision ratios server-side
so dashboards and shell recipes do not have to re-derive them (and
can no longer drift from the
[`Legendary_counters` SSOT helpers](#derived-ratios-ssot)). All three
values are finite floats — the endpoint never emits `NaN` / `inf`,
even when every counter is `0`. The log stream and the counter
snapshot remain redundant on purpose: logs for point-in-time
diagnostics, counters for trend math over a rolling window.

### Derived ratios (SSOT)

Dashboards and flip-decision tooling should use the
`Legendary_counters` helpers rather than re-deriving the math from
raw fields — three different shell recipes and a UI drifted apart
twice already. The helpers return `0.0` when their denominator is
zero so the JSON output stays a finite float even with the observer
off:

| Helper | Formula | Flip criterion |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `disagree_ratio snap` | `(legacy_allow_shadow_deny + legacy_deny_shadow_allow) / gate_diff_total` | `MASC_BASH_AST_ONLY` target: `0.0` over 7-day window |
| `shadow_parse_coverage snap` | `1.0 - shadow_cannot_parse / gate_diff_total` | `MASC_BASH_AST_ONLY` target: `>= 0.99` (parse gap `< 1%`) |
| `auto_bg_promotion_rate snap` | `would_have_promoted / auto_bg_observed` | Input to `MASC_BLOCKING_BUDGET_MS` tuning + `MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG` default-flip review |

The signatures live in `lib/legendary_counters.mli`; reach for them
from any new dashboard chip, Slack formatter, or CI gate before
open-coding the ratio yourself.

The `too_complex_*` family is a histogram refinement of the single
`gate_diff_shadow_cannot_parse` bucket: each subset-excluded bash
feature gets its own counter, so operators can see which construct
is driving the parse gap and prioritise future grammar expansion.
The sum of all `too_complex_*` buckets equals
`gate_diff_shadow_cannot_parse` — `too_complex_other` catches
unknown reason strings so the invariant holds even if a future
variant is added to `Parsed.reason_too_complex` without updating
the counter routing table.  Top candidates for A1-PR-N grammar
expansion are simply the top-N buckets over an observation window.

## Background Task Roster Endpoint

The `keeper_bash` P2 background task lifecycle tracks long-running
shell tasks in an in-process registry (`Bg_task.list`). The roster is
exposed for a given keeper through a second public-read endpoint so
that dashboards can render "tasks currently owned by this keeper"
without scraping logs:

```
GET /api/v1/legendary_bash/bg_tasks/<keeper>
```

Response shape:

```json
{
  "keeper": "<name>",
  "count": 2,
  "tasks": ["<task_id_1>", "<task_id_2>"],
  "task_details": [
    {
      "task_id": "<task_id_1>",
      "started_at_unix": 1730000000.123,
      "elapsed_ms": 4821
    },
    {
      "task_id": "<task_id_2>",
      "started_at_unix": 1730000030.456,
      "elapsed_ms": 15234
    }
  ]
}
```

Unknown or quiet keepers legitimately return
`{"count": 0, "tasks": [], "task_details": []}` — the endpoint does
not gate on keeper existence, matching the `shadow_counters`
"zero-cost public read" posture. The path param is required; a
trailing-slash request (`.../bg_tasks/`) returns 400.

`task_details` mirrors `tasks` in order (`tasks[i]` equals
`task_details[i].task_id`). `started_at_unix` is the fractional
seconds-since-epoch captured at spawn and is immutable for a task's
lifetime. `elapsed_ms` is computed server-side at response time so
dashboards do not need to reconcile against their local clock — a
subsequent poll returns a larger `elapsed_ms` for the same
`started_at_unix` until the task exits (and leaves the roster).

Per-task snapshots (stdout drain, exit status, drop counters) are not
surfaced by this endpoint — those require a stateful `since_*` offset
and live inside the `keeper_bash_output` MCP tool. This endpoint is
intentionally cheap and stateless so a dashboard can poll it on a
short interval without coordinating cursors across callers.

## Rollback

Each Legendary flag has an inert opt-out path. No restart required.

```bash
# P1 — restore pre-P1 byte-identical JSON shape
export MASC_BASH_SEMANTIC_EXIT=0

# P6 — drop typed verifiable markers
export MASC_BASH_VERIFIABLE_MARKERS=0

# P4 — disable auto-promotion (already default)
unset MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG

# P5 — return to dual-gate (already default)
unset MASC_BASH_AST_ONLY

# Observers — stop emitting dark-launch log lines
unset MASC_BASH_AUTO_BG_OBSERVE
unset MASC_BASH_AST_SHADOW_LOG
```

Output caps (`MASC_BASH_OUTPUT_CAP` + `CAP_HEAD` + `CAP_TAIL`) are not
treated as rollback surface — truncation is always safer than unbounded
logs.

## When to consult this runbook

- Before flipping any `MASC_BASH_*` default in production.
- When triaging a surprise JSON field on a `keeper_bash` response.
- When an operator asks "what do these `gate_diff_shadow` /
  `auto_bg_would_have_promoted` log lines mean?"
- When adding a new exec-layer flag: mirror the matrix row and observer
  pattern below, then update this file in the same PR.

## Rules for new Legendary flags

1. Every behavior-changing flag must land as opt-in (`default off`) with
   an explicit matrix row in `ENV-CONTRACT.md §4`.
2. Defaults flip only after a dark-launch observer has confirmed
   non-regression.
3. Flip PRs must update this runbook's "Current Rollout State" table in
   the same commit — the table is the operator's source of truth.
4. Rollback path stays inert and restart-free on the keeper-bash path.
