# Keeper Runtime Truth Unification Goal

Date: 2026-05-12
Status: not product-ready; latest live liveness fails fast with a structured no-tool-capable-provider terminal
Parent audit: `docs/audit/2026-05-12-keeper-oas-agent-runtime-flow-comparison.md`

## Current Implementation Slice

Implemented in this branch:

- `Keeper_runtime_manifest` schema, JSON codec, path helper, and append helper.
- Manifest append failures now record `Telemetry_coverage_gap` rows instead of
  disappearing into warn logs only.
- JSONL destination convention:
  `.masc/keepers/<keeper>/runtime-manifests/<trace_id>.jsonl`.
- Runtime hooks for:
  `turn_started`, `phase_gate_decided`, `cascade_routed`,
  `pre_dispatch_blocked`, `tool_surface_selected`,
  `provider_lane_resolved`, `provider_attempt_started`,
  `provider_attempt_finished`, `context_injected`, `context_compacted`,
  `state_snapshot_sidecar_saved`, `working_state_sidecar_saved`,
  `event_bus_correlated`,
  `memory_injected`, `memory_flushed`, `checkpoint_loaded`,
  `checkpoint_saved`, `receipt_appended`, and `turn_finished`.
- Provider-lane manifest decisions now record requested tools, required tools,
  materialized tools, missing required tools, resolved lane, effective inline
  tool count, and runtime MCP policy presence.
- Required-tool turns now fail before provider dispatch if the resolved provider
  lane cannot materialize the required tools.
- Successful provider turns now persist structured keeper state snapshots to:
  - `<session_dir>/state-snapshots/turn-000001.json`
  - `<session_dir>/state-snapshot.latest.json`
- Successful provider turns now persist compact keeper working-state vessels to:
  - `<session_dir>/working-state/turn-000001.json`
  - `<session_dir>/working-state.latest.json`
- Context manifest rows record prompt/context/history digests. A dedicated
  `state_snapshot_sidecar_saved` row links the structured state snapshot
  sidecars after the provider run, and `working_state_sidecar_saved` links the
  compact working-state vessel sidecars.
- `Keeper_cascade_engine` now encodes the keeper cascade boundary as a typed
  value: MASC owns named-cascade provider iteration and hands OAS a
  single-provider agent run per attempt.
- Runtime manifest decision rows now include `cascade_engine`,
  `oas_dispatch_mode`, and `oas_internal_cascade_allowed`.
- A focused guard still checks that the keeper hot path does not call OAS
  `Complete_cascade`, but the primary invariant is now typed and runtime
  visible.
- Keeper manifest/FSM turn ids now use the next keeper turn id
  (`total_turns + 1`) consistently across pre-dispatch, provider-attempt, and
  post-provider manifest rows. OAS SDK turn count remains separate as
  `oas_turn_count`.
- `masc-trace <base-path> <keeper> <turn_id>` now also reads
  `runtime-manifests` rows and prints them beside receipt/FSM/tool-call
  evidence. It also prints a `turn identity` summary that separates keeper
  turn id, max OAS SDK turn count, provider attempt counts, checkpoint rows,
  receipt rows, terminal rows, Event_bus correlation id, and compaction
  start/complete counters. It also prints memory injection/flush row counts.
- `GET /api/v1/keepers/<name>/runtime-trace?trace_id=<trace>&turn_id=<n>`
  now returns manifest rows, matching receipt rows, and linked artifact
  presence for dashboard/operator use. The response includes `turn_identity`
  with manifest keeper turn ids, receipt turn counts, max OAS turn count, and
  provider/checkpoint/receipt/Event_bus counters. It also includes an
  `event_bus` summary with correlation ids, run ids, and compaction counts.
  It also includes a `memory` summary with injection/flush counts and flushed
  episode/procedure counts.
- `/runtime-trace` now includes a derived `runtime_lens` object. It keeps the
  manifest schema at v1 and normalizes the existing decision rows into
  `turn_clock`, axis summaries, owner swimlanes, and code-shaped `gaps`.
- Keeper detail now fetches the runtime-trace endpoint and renders compact
  FsmHub evidence chips for trace health, keeper/OAS turn identity,
  Event_bus/compaction counters, and memory injection/flush counts.
- Keeper detail also renders a Runtime Lens section under runtime diagnostics:
  tool required/materialized/missing, provider lane, context compaction,
  memory flush, and per-owner swimlane status are visible without reading raw
  manifest JSON.
- `/runtime-trace` now includes a `provider_attempts` summary with start/finish
  counts, terminal status/error/exception, and compact attempt rows. It does
  not expose terminal provider/model identifiers. Keeper detail renders that
  terminal provider chip directly in FsmHub so operator-visible failure
  evidence no longer requires opening raw manifest JSON.
- `scripts/keeper-runtime-truth-gate.sh` now provides a read-only live proof
  gate for an existing keeper turn. It checks manifest events, provider-lane
  boundary fields, Event_bus summary fields, memory-injection fields, linked
  receipt/checkpoint/tool-call artifacts, and can also verify the
  `/runtime-trace` API when `--server-url` is provided. The
  `--self-test` mode builds a temporary fixture so the gate itself is locally
  testable without mutating live runtime state. Its self-test now covers both
  a successful provider turn with a checkpoint and a timeout/error provider
  turn where the OAS context rolls back without `checkpoint_saved`; the latter
  is accepted only when `turn_finished.status = error` and provider
  start/finish counts are terminal.
- Focused test binary: `test/test_keeper_runtime_manifest.ml` with focused
  manifest/runtime trace regressions,
  including:
  - a producer fixture that calls the pre-dispatch terminal path and verifies
    manifest JSONL rows plus the linked receipt path;
  - a successful provider/OAS-run fixture that calls `keeper_tool_search`
    through a local Provider-D-compatible mock and verifies the manifest,
    checkpoint, state sidecar, tool-call log, and receipt chain together.
  - a provider-lane matrix regression that covers inline-only,
    runtime-MCP-only, mixed, no-tool, and runtime-MCP-connect-only surfaces.
  - checkpoint-load fixtures proving canonical OAS checkpoints carry replay
    metadata without `state-snapshot.latest.json` recovery hydration.
  - a read-only runtime trace API fixture proving manifest rows and matching
    execution receipt rows are joined through the operator endpoint JSON.
  - Runtime Lens API fixtures proving the tool axis reports
    requested/required/materialized/missing tools, required-tool lane gaps are
    code-shaped as `required_tool_not_materialized`, and context/memory rows
    are grouped into the `memory_context` swimlane.
  - a typed cascade-engine boundary fixture proving keeper runtime dispatch
    uses `single_provider_agent_run` and disables OAS-internal cascade fallback.
- `test/test_memory_hooks.ml` now covers runtime manifest rows from the
  hook-first memory path: `memory_injected` and `memory_flushed`.
- Direct model-string keeper runs now use direct-call defaults for
  strategy/concurrency knobs when no active cascade catalog exists. Named
  cascades still fail closed on catalog resolution errors.
- `test/test_keeper_unified.ml` no longer depends on the deleted
  `config/cascade.json` fixture; it now copies `config/cascade.toml` for its
  temp config root. Its livelock priming uses the same next-turn id convention
  as the runtime.
- Declarative cascade validation now accepts 5-layer `tier.*` and
  `tier-group.*` profiles from the declarative snapshot, instead of requiring
  legacy `<profile>_models` materialization for every route target.
- `routes.*.target` values are preserved while the live catalog is not yet
  validated, instead of collapsing to a legacy alias that may not exist in the
  declarative `cascade.toml`.
- Degraded retry now distinguishes phase aliases (`local_only`,
  `local_recovery`) from concrete fallback profiles with the same historical
  names. Generic fail-open follows the configured phase-recovery route; concrete
  `local_recovery` is used only when explicitly hinted.
- Required-tool degraded retries prepend the default route when catalog-owned
  rotation is present, so filtering recovery/control lanes does not leave a
  required-tool turn with no valid same-turn recovery path.
- `masc_keeper_up` now accepts and validates a public `cascade_name` argument,
  matching the legacy-model removal error text and schema. Invalid or
  system-only cascades fail before keeper creation.
- `save_private_text_file` now uses `Fun.protect` for channel cleanup inside
  blocking/systhread auth I/O, avoiding an Eio cancellation-context effect
  outside a fiber while still guaranteeing `close_out_noerr`.
- `scripts/harness/workload/keeper_continuity_validation.sh` was updated for
  the current MCP and keeper contracts:
  - bearer token is loaded from the isolated base path before tool calls;
  - MCP `initialize` is performed and `Mcp-Session-Id` is reused;
  - removed `models`, `presence_keepalive`, and `require_existing` args are no
    longer sent;
  - `masc_keeper_msg` queued responses are not treated as turn completion;
  - liveness waits for `meta.total_turns` to advance;
  - continuity waits for both `meta.total_turns` and continuity state to
    advance;
  - liveness/continuity timeout summaries read the runtime manifest for the
    expected turn and include terminal status, terminal reason, provider
    status, and provider error when the turn failed after queueing;
  - phase logging survives helper failures and empty snapshot paths.
- Provider attempts now close their manifest chain on all locally observable
  terminal paths. Normal `Ok`/`Error` provider returns emit
  `provider_attempt_finished` inside the provider-attempt scope. If the outer
  keeper/OAS bridge timeout interrupts the attempt before `run_named` can
  unwind normally, `Keeper_agent_run` repairs the last unmatched
  `provider_attempt_started` row with a terminal
  `provider_attempt_finished` row carrying `status = timeout`,
  `exception_kind = outer_oas_timeout`, and the bridge error text.
- Attempt-liveness tick fibers now have an explicit stop signal. A provider
  can return a terminal API error before the liveness FSM sees a terminal
  stream event; the attempt owner now wakes the tick fiber before leaving the
  attempt switch so the original provider error is not masked as a 120s outer
  timeout.
- `no_tool_capable_provider` now remains a structured terminal reason instead
  of collapsing to `internal_error`. The runtime manifest also records a
  `pre_dispatch_blocked` row with the configured labels, required tool names,
  provider rejections, and MASC/OAS cascade-boundary fields.
- `masc-mcp doctor config` now checks the live validated
  `keeper_turn`/`tool_required` routes for forced required-tool capability.
  Routes that resolve only to providers without inline `tool_choice` or runtime
  MCP are reported as `error` before a keeper turn reaches runtime failure.
- OAS pin is bumped to `v0.193.9` /
  `3cdaa363d4c8dc41abb9da085739d273bad26f21`, with `dune-project`,
  `masc_mcp.opam`, docs, and `scripts/oas-api-surface.json` regenerated from
  that pinned OAS checkout.

Latest-main live evidence:

- Current branch was rebased onto `origin/main` at
  `429cf1c47cc1f69c8ba55f88491017cde53117c5`
  (`HEAD` merge-base with `origin/main` is
  `429cf1c47cc1f69c8ba55f88491017cde53117c5`).
- Current OAS pin matches the OAS turn-durability review head at
  `3cdaa363d4c8dc41abb9da085739d273bad26f21` (`v0.193.9`).
- Bootstrap-only isolated run:
  `/private/tmp/keeper-runtime-truth-live-20260512-bootstrap9`
  classified `PASS`; phase log shows active keepalive and room presence.
- The active config root used in the live run was
  `/Users/dancer/me/.masc/config`, whose active catalog default was
  `provider-k-coding-with-spark`. The harness no longer hardcodes `primary`.
- Latest post-fix live-like liveness rerun:
  `/private/tmp/keeper-runtime-truth-live-20260512-codex5`
  classified `FAIL`; bootstrap passed, liveness still timed out after the
  queued keeper message.
- The codex5 phase summary is now operator-actionable:
  `turn_status=error terminal_reason=api_error_timeout provider_status=timeout
  provider_error=Timeout: Timeout after 120.0s (budget=120s)`.
- The codex5 manifest includes the previously missing terminal row:
  `provider_attempt_finished` with `status = timeout` and
  `exception_kind = outer_oas_timeout`.
- `scripts/keeper-runtime-truth-gate.sh` passes against the codex5 failed
  live-like turn. It accepts absent `checkpoint_saved` and absent
  `event_bus_correlated` only because `turn_finished.status = error`, treating
  that as an OAS rollback/pre-correlation terminal-failure path rather than a
  healthy success path.
- Post tick-stop live run:
  `/private/tmp/keeper-runtime-truth-live-20260513-codex8` still classified
  `FAIL`, but the insufficient-balance provider error propagated after
  `0.738s` instead of being masked as a 120s outer timeout.
- Latest live run:
  `/private/tmp/keeper-runtime-truth-live-20260513-codex9` classified `FAIL`;
  phase summary reports `turn_status=error
  terminal_reason=no_tool_capable_provider`.
- The codex9 manifest includes `pre_dispatch_blocked` with
  `reason = no_tool_capable_provider`, `candidate_count = 1`,
  `require_tool_support = true`, and non-identifying rejection reasons.
- The codex9 receipt and `turn_finished` rows both carry
  `terminal_reason_code = no_tool_capable_provider`.
- Current live `masc-mcp doctor config --base-path /Users/dancer/me --json`
  also reports `status = error` for the same route capability gap:
  both `keeper_turn` and `tool_required` target `tier-group.provider-k-coding-with-spark`, and
  its single candidate is rejected for forced required-tool use with
  `runtime_mcp_caps_missing`.

## Runtime Lens Normalization (2026-05-13)

The raw manifest is implemented and remains the durable SSOT. Runtime Lens is
a read-time projection over those rows; it does not introduce a second JSONL
stream or a schema-v2 manifest.

Mapping:

- HTML item 1, "orthogonal axes", is represented by
  `/runtime-trace.runtime_lens.axes`: lifecycle, tool surface, provider lane,
  provider attempt, context, and memory.
- HTML item 4, "simultaneous swimlanes", is represented by
  `/runtime-trace.runtime_lens.swimlanes`: keeper, MASC policy/cascade, OAS,
  provider, tool runtime, and memory/context.
- Tool visibility mismatch is not left as prose. It is emitted as gap code
  `required_tool_not_materialized` with the missing required tool names in
  `detail`.
- Provider/materialization ambiguity is emitted as `provider_lane_unresolved`.
  Missing terminal, context, and memory rows are represented as
  `missing_turn_finished`, `context_delta_missing`, and
  `memory_flush_missing`.
- Runtime Lens and the provider-attempt summary are intentionally
  provider/model-free: they report provider-lane resolution, attempt status,
  capability/materialization status, and gaps, but they do not copy
  `provider_kind`, `model_id`, `terminal_provider_kind`, or
  `terminal_model_id` into product-facing summary objects.
- New `Keeper_runtime_manifest` rows no longer expose provider/model fields in
  the typed row contract or serialized JSON. The parser remains tolerant of
  legacy v1 rows that still contain those keys, and the writer recursively
  redacts provider/model-shaped decision keys before appending rows.
- Keeper runtime manifest producer decisions avoid provider/model-shaped
  diagnostic keys at source. Attempt rows keep lane status, timing, checkpoint
  presence, errors, and candidate/rejection counts rather than provider labels,
  model ids, provider health keys, configured provider labels, or response
  model ids.
- `no_tool_capable_provider` SDK error payloads and summaries now follow the
  same rule: they retain required tool names, candidate counts, and rejection
  reasons, but omit configured provider labels and rejected provider identities.
- Keeper runtime/social status JSON keeps the legacy `active_model_label` and
  `last_model_used_label` keys for compatibility but sets them to `null` so
  the status surface does not resolve provider/model display labels.
- Keeper status detail, runtime trust, composite execution, and keeper FSM
  helper projections keep legacy keys such as `active_model`, `selected_model`,
  `model_used`, `provider_selected_model`, `models_resolved`,
  `cascade_models`, and `last_provider_result` for compatibility but return
  `null` or empty lists for provider/model identity. They still expose
  non-identifying cascade outcome, attempt count, fallback state, tool
  contract, sandbox, and runtime blocker signals.
- Keeper execution receipt JSON and the derived operator-broadcast payload keep
  compatibility keys such as `model_used` and `cascade.selected_model`, but
  set them to `null`. Receipt runtime contracts no longer pass a concrete
  provider/model label from MASC into the public contract JSON.
- Keeper decision-log rows and metrics snapshot JSONL rows now treat
  provider/model fields as compatibility-only projection keys. They keep
  cascade name, strategy, selected index, fallback state, attempt count, timing,
  errors, usage, and tool evidence, but set `model_used`, `resolved_model_id`,
  `provider_context.selected_model`, `cascade.selected_model`,
  `cascade.primary_model`, `cascade.selected_model_raw`, configured labels, and
  candidate model lists to `null` or `[]`.
- Dashboard legacy normalizers and fleet/detail display helpers now treat
  model/provider fields as non-product data even when older payloads still
  contain them. `keeper-store-normalize`, fleet telemetry rows, Runtime Alert
  Strip, KPI cards, metrics charts, FsmHub receipt labels, and Turn FSM detail
  keep cascade lane/outcome/attempt/fallback evidence but no longer render
  concrete model/provider labels or model-switch timelines.
- Governance and board dashboard adapters follow the same rule for human-facing
  product surfaces: judge/approval cards preserve keeper name, status, action,
  runtime contract, and sandbox evidence, while `model_used` and
  `selected_model` normalize to `null` or are omitted from display. The same
  projection rule applies to persisted governance judgment rows and
  operator-judgment records: MASC keeps freshness/status evidence, not concrete
  OAS provider/model identity.
- Model-inference and cost/latency projections keep internal aggregation math
  unchanged, but the public JSON boundary now emits neutral runtime lane labels
  for compatibility fields such as `model_id`, `agent`, and matrix axes, and
  emits `provider = null` or `runtime` rather than concrete provider/model
  identities. Keeper cost aggregates and keeper-decision dashboards likewise
  hide raw `model_used`; the UI labels these views as runtime lanes instead of
  provider/model matrices. SSE journal text and operator digest normalization
  no longer surface raw keeper-turn or judge model labels.
- Keeper detail metric windows and handoff summaries now keep legacy keys such
  as `model_used`, `primary_model`, `handoff_to_model`, and `to_model` as
  compatibility fields, but public projection values are `null` or the neutral
  `runtime` bucket.
- Operator control snapshots preserve keeper phase, cascade name, trust, and
  context evidence, but redact `primary_model`, `active_model`,
  `last_model_used`, and model hint/label fields from operator-facing rows.
- Keeper approval queue projections, audit rows, and resolution broadcasts keep
  `selected_model` for compatibility but emit `null`; HITL policy and sandbox
  evidence remain visible.
- Channel Gate turn stats preserve duration/token metrics but collapse the
  legacy in-memory model slot to `runtime`; outbound wire JSON keeps
  `model_used` only as a compatibility key and emits `null`.
- Dashboard harness wake-payload telemetry and Yjs keeper updates keep the
  legacy `model_id` key but emit the neutral `runtime` lane.
- The OAS dashboard telemetry bridge accepts provider/model compatibility
  fields at ingress, but normalizes samples, provider-error counters, filters,
  and SSE/REST projections to the neutral `runtime` lane before MASC stores
  them.
- Operator pending-confirm runtime metadata keeps `model_used` as a
  compatibility key only and emits `null` at the boundary.
- Keeper detail provider-health projections, keeper execution memory context,
  keeper turn-complete SSE, and keeper turn-completed event payloads retain
  operational status/usage fields while redacting provider/model identity
  fields to `null`.
- Keeper meta JSON keeps the legacy `last_model_used` key but writes it as an
  empty string so new persisted meta does not carry concrete provider/model
  labels.
- Cost ledger JSONL keeps status diagnostics but redacts persisted `provider`
  and `model` values to the neutral `runtime` lane. MASC no longer estimates
  provider/model pricing locally or emits `cost_pricing_model` /
  `cost_pricing_catalog` compatibility fields; `cost_usd` is trusted only when
  OAS reports it, otherwise the row is marked `oas_cost_unreported`.
- No-tool provider rejection records carry only non-identifying rejection
  reasons in the MASC structured error type. Legacy payloads with
  provider/model-shaped fields still parse, but those identities are not
  re-emitted.
- Cascade attempt-liveness observer metrics keep the historical `provider`
  label key for dashboard compatibility but emit the neutral `runtime` lane.
  Liveness budget history also uses a single neutral runtime candidate key
  instead of retaining concrete provider/model keys.
- Provider-error and OAS-run-timeout Prometheus counters also retain their
  historical `provider` label key for compatibility, but the value is the
  neutral `runtime` lane. Error kind, cascade, capacity scope, and timeout
  source remain visible.
- The typed `Provider_error` contract itself is runtime-lane scoped: variants
  no longer store provider/model identifiers, and legacy JSON keys such as
  `provider`, `affected`, and `model_name` emit neutral `runtime` values only.
- Cascade catalog runtime probe JSON and provider-health probe metric labels
  keep status/error/profile evidence but redact provider kind, model id,
  model string, endpoint, and metric provider/model labels to neutral runtime
  values.
- Cascade legacy observations and attempt/fallback audit rows now store
  runtime-lane candidate identities. Keeper turn-driver fallback, cooldown,
  preflight, and retry logs also use runtime labels instead of concrete
  provider/model labels.
- Keeper cascade bookkeeping now routes through `Cascade_runtime_candidate` for
  health keys, capacity keys, HTTP probe registration, strategy ordering, and
  per-attempt timeout bounds. `Keeper_turn_driver` no longer exposes a public
  `Provider_config.t` timeout helper or directly inspects provider kind,
  `base_url`, or model id for these decisions; concrete provider config is
  unwrapped only at the OAS dispatch adapter.
- Keeper liveness/pre-skip helpers no longer expose
  `Provider_config.t`-returning label resolvers. They operate on neutral
  label-to-runtime-URL resolution from `Cascade_runtime_candidate`, keeping
  provider config parsing outside the keeper liveness API.
- Keeper usage-trust classification no longer exposes provider-kind arguments.
  The OAS hook derives a cache-capability boolean from telemetry, and the
  trust classifier consumes only that capability plus usage/context evidence.
- Keeper turn-context label filtering no longer parses configured labels into
  `Provider_config.t` locally; model-id compatibility checks go through
  `Cascade_runtime_candidate`.
- Keeper OAS hook public helpers no longer accept provider-kind arguments.
  Typed provider evidence is consumed inside telemetry bridge helpers, while
  bare keeper-facing model labels remain unknown unless explicitly
  provider-qualified.
- `Keeper_turn_driver.mli` no longer re-exports the full `Cascade_oas_runner`
  or provider-attempt FSM surfaces, and it now exposes an explicit structured
  error surface instead of all `Cascade_error_classify` helpers. Provider/model
  shaped helpers such as tool-filter classification, default model-string
  lookup, label-to-config construction, Agent-Code preflight, and provider-specific
  error enrichment must be reached through lower-level OAS boundary modules,
  not the keeper facade.
- `/runtime-trace.manifest_rows` and `/runtime-trace.receipts` are public API
  projections, not byte-for-byte raw artifacts. They recursively redact
  provider/model identifier keys such as `provider_kind`, `model_id`,
  `response_model`, provider health keys, and configured provider labels.

Dashboard behavior:

- Keeper detail shows Runtime Lens before lower-level runtime diagnostics.
- Redacted `manifest_rows` remain in the API response for debug tooling, but
  the product surface uses the normalized axis/swimlane summary first.
- Missing fields parse to `unknown`, `null`, empty arrays, or zero counts so
  older trace payloads do not crash the dashboard.

Boundary follow-up:

- The stricter target, "MASC does not know provider/model and only OAS owns
  those details", is not fully complete in this branch. This branch removes
  provider/model identity from the new keeper runtime manifest/API/dashboard
  contract plus selected legacy status/trust projections, and moves keeper
  cascade bookkeeping and keeper-facade API boundaries behind opaque/runtime
  adapters. The latest cleanup also moves direct keeper use of
  `Llm_provider.Provider_config`, `Llm_provider.Model_meta`,
  `Cascade_config.parse_model_strings`, and provider health-key derivation
  behind `Cascade_runtime_candidate` for liveness, cooldown/recovery,
  context-window, and memory-threshold decisions. The after-turn
  `response.model` resolver, keeper OAS hook cost/tool metrics, tool-call
  handler model labels, and runtime-contract provider/model compatibility
  fields now collapse to neutral runtime lanes rather than canonicalizing or
  inferring concrete provider/model identities. Older unified-turn token,
  cache, context-window, latency-bucket, and usage-anomaly metric labels also
  emit the neutral runtime lane instead of concrete `model_used` /
  `resolved_model_id` values. Legacy keeper `models` inputs are now rejected
  or ignored at parse/reconcile boundaries; runtime label selection must flow
  through the named TOML cascade.
- Residual work remains: pricing/telemetry labels, auth/display helpers,
  runtime-MCP quirks, local-default labels, dashboard debug fixtures, and
  broader cascade config/catalog/transport surfaces still know concrete
  providers/models by design or history.

## Goal

Make every keeper turn explainable from one evidence chain:

```
keeper stimulus
-> phase gate
-> cascade route
-> provider attempts
-> tool surface and provider lane
-> OAS SDK turns
-> context/memory/compaction decisions
-> checkpoint
-> execution receipt
```

The product-level target is not "more logs". The target is that an operator,
dashboard, CLI, or reviewer can answer why a turn succeeded, skipped, failed,
or retried without reconstructing the story from unrelated files.

## Product Health Assessment

Current state is improved and closer to product-grade, but the latest-main
live run is still a hard stop for a product-ready claim. The immediate
hardening slice is healthy enough to ship as an observability/reliability
improvement, because it now exposes timeout and pre-dispatch capability
failures precisely and the gate can validate failed turn chains. The keeper
runtime as a whole is not healthy enough to call fully product-ready until live
provider turns finish reliably or the active keeper route includes a concrete
tool-capable provider.

Healthy parts:

- Keeper pre-dispatch skips/errors are receipt-backed.
- Tool selection has explicit policy gates, required-tool checks, and
  reported/observed/canonical reconciliation.
- MASC owns logical cascade/runtime-lane routing and non-identifying attempt
  observations.
- OAS owns the generic single-agent loop, tool execution loop, context reducer,
  memory primitive, checkpoint primitive, and compaction machinery.
- Boundary documentation already states that OAS must stay generic while MASC
  owns world/task/board/governance semantics.
- The current declarative cascade route target (`tier-group.primary`) is now
  accepted by the active catalog validator and broad keeper lifecycle tests.
- The latest live-like run no longer hides queued `masc_keeper_msg` responses
  as successful turns; the harness waits for actual turn state.

Fragile parts:

- A single human concept, "turn", is split across MASC keeper turn,
  MASC cascade attempt, and OAS SDK turn counters.
- Tool surface selection happens before the final provider lane is known.
  The current branch now detects impossible required-tool lanes before provider
  dispatch and has a successful provider/OAS fixture proving manifest rows and
  receipts line up in one actual turn. The remaining gap is provider-lane
  E2E breadth, not the pure lane contract or the existence of the causal
  chain.
- The keeper hot path uses MASC cascade, while OAS also has a generic
  `Complete_cascade`; both are valid but must not be mixed accidentally. This
  branch now adds a typed `Keeper_cascade_engine` boundary, records the dispatch
  mode in runtime manifests, and keeps a source guard as a secondary alarm.
- Runtime context is split across MASC `working_context`, OAS checkpoint,
  raw `[STATE]` text, memory hooks, memory bank, and receipts.
- Structured state snapshot sidecars reduce dependence on raw `[STATE]` for
  live evidence surfaces, but OAS checkpoint load no longer hydrates missing
  replay metadata from `state-snapshot.latest.json`.
  Remaining work is broader live evidence and dashboard/API read surfaces.
- Compaction evidence is now represented in two places: the pre-dispatch
  checkpoint/compaction decision row and a final `event_bus_correlated` row
  that carries the OAS Event_bus correlation id, run id, overflow hint, and
  proactive/emergency compaction counters for the keeper turn. Hook-first
  memory injection and after-turn flush are now joined through
  `memory_injected` and `memory_flushed` rows. Remaining context risk is
  broader live evidence and deeper quality metrics for what memory/compaction
  preserved or dropped.
- Cascade alias semantics are now encoded in tests, but the long-term shape
  should still remove module-init route constants in favor of explicit dynamic
  route resolution or literal phase sentinels. The current slice closes the
  observed failures, not the whole historical naming ambiguity.
- Production-like config no longer masks the observed provider error as a
  120-second outer timeout, but the active keeper route still does not
  complete a keeper turn under production-like config. The latest failure is
  now earlier and more precise: `no_tool_capable_provider` because the active
  route has no candidate that materializes the required keeper tool support.
  `masc-mcp doctor config` now catches this same route-capability
  gap without starting a keeper turn.
- Live config drift is real: the current config root exposes `provider-k-coding-with-spark` as
  the only active catalog profile, while older scripts assumed `primary`.
  The harness now avoids that hardcoded default, but operator docs/config still
  need cleanup.
- Local Docker is not reachable on this host, so declarative docker keepers in
  the active config repeatedly fail sandbox preflight during live runs. This is
  not the direct cause of the test keeper's local-profile liveness failure, but
  it adds production noise and should be separated from provider-runtime
  failures in operator surfaces.

### Product Readiness Gate

Verdict as of this slice: do not promote as fully product-healthy yet.

It is acceptable to ship behind an operator-facing experimental gate if the
goal is observability hardening. It is not yet acceptable as a final product
runtime guarantee because the strongest live-like evidence on latest main now
fails at route capability: the keeper message queues, but the active
`tier-group.provider-k-coding-with-spark` route has no tool-capable provider for the keeper's
materialized internal tool surface.

Highest-risk gaps:

1. Route capability gap: latest live run
   `/private/tmp/keeper-runtime-truth-live-20260513-codex9` fails with
   `no_tool_capable_provider`. The manifest now records
   `pre_dispatch_blocked`, and the receipt/turn terminal reason stays
   structured. `masc-mcp doctor config` now fails with the same diagnosis
   before dispatch. Still open: configure `tier-group.provider-k-coding-with-spark` with a
   concrete tool-capable provider for keeper-internal tools, or route these
   keeper turns to a provider lane that can materialize runtime MCP/inline
   tools.
2. Real-turn evidence gap: closed for focused fixture coverage. The successful
   provider/OAS fixture proves the manifest, checkpoint, state sidecar,
   tool-call log, and receipt chain together. Remaining risk is live
   long-running keeper evidence under production-like config.
3. Turn identity gap: the immediate off-by-one hazard between pre-dispatch and
   provider paths is fixed in this branch, and `masc-trace` plus
   `/runtime-trace` now expose a `turn_identity` summary. Keeper detail now
   renders that summary as compact evidence chips. Remaining risk is
   drill-down depth and live long-running evidence, not backend/API visibility.
4. Tool contract gap: pure lane-matrix coverage now exists for inline-only,
   runtime-MCP-only, mixed, no-tool, and runtime-MCP-connect-only surfaces.
   Remaining risk is E2E provider-kind coverage for concrete transports.
5. Context ownership gap: checkpoint load now uses the latest state sidecar
   before raw `[STATE]` re-derivation when structured checkpoint metadata is
   absent. Hook-first memory injection/flush now has manifest rows. Remaining
   risk is broader live keeper evidence, non-checkpoint operator surfaces, and
   preservation-quality metrics.
6. Operator surface gap: `masc-trace`,
   `/api/v1/keepers/:name/runtime-trace` now expose manifest rows and linked
   receipt artifacts, Event_bus correlation, compaction counters, and
   memory-injection/flush summaries. The API also exposes provider-attempt
   terminal status/error directly, and
   `scripts/keeper-runtime-truth-gate.sh` can validate the chain from an
   existing live turn. The keeper detail FsmHub now has compact evidence
   chips for that endpoint, including provider terminal status. Remaining
   risk is collecting/publishing live long-running keeper evidence under
   production-like config and improving drill-down beyond the compact summary.
7. Cascade plane gap: the keeper/OAS cascade-plane invariant is now typed and
   visible in manifests. Remaining risk is that future non-keeper entry points
   may need the same explicit engine classification if they reuse parts of the
   driver.
8. Cascade naming gap: `test/test_keeper_unified.exe` is now green under
   `config/cascade.toml`, but the codebase still carries historical
   `default`/`local_only`/`local_recovery` aliases beside declarative
   `tier.*` and `tier-group.*` profiles. This should be simplified before
   treating route semantics as final.

## Done Criteria

This goal is complete only when all of the following are true:

1. Each keeper turn has a durable runtime decision manifest.
2. The manifest links keeper turn id, trace id, generation, OAS SDK turn count,
   cascade name, provider attempt count, checkpoint ids, and receipt path/id.
3. The manifest records phase-gate, cascade-route, provider-attempt,
   tool-surface, provider-lane, context-injection, compaction, checkpoint, and
   receipt decisions, plus the OAS Event_bus correlation/run ids and memory
   injection/flush decisions observed for the turn.
4. Required-tool decisions prove whether the tool was available inline,
   through runtime MCP, or unavailable for the actual provider lane.
5. Keeper hot path has a documented/tested invariant: MASC cascade owns keeper
   provider iteration; OAS `Complete_cascade` is not silently used there.
6. Context/checkpoint ownership has a documented migration path and at least one
   code slice reducing MASC `working_context` dependence or moving continuity
   to structured sidecars.
7. There is an operator surface, even if minimal CLI first, that can read one
   turn and print the evidence chain.
8. Focused tests or verifiers cover the manifest producer and at least one
   pre-dispatch path plus one successful OAS-run path.

## Completion Audit (2026-05-12)

Objective restated: produce a code-level and flowchart-level audit of Keeper,
tools, provider/model/cascade, external agent turn loops, and
compaction/memory/context behavior; then merge the most important improvement
into the product so runtime readiness can be judged from evidence.

Prompt-to-artifact checklist:

1. Keeper lifecycle: covered by
   `docs/audit/2026-05-12-keeper-oas-agent-runtime-flow-comparison.md` section
   1 and runtime-manifest rows for `turn_started`, `phase_gate_decided`,
   `cascade_routed`, `pre_dispatch_blocked`, provider attempts, receipts, and
   terminal turn events.
2. Tool search/use flow: covered by audit section 2 and manifest/test coverage
   for `tool_surface_selected`, `provider_lane_resolved`, required-tool lane
   mismatches, and inline/runtime-MCP/no-tool matrices.
3. Provider/model/cascade flow: covered by audit section 3, the typed
   `Keeper_cascade_engine` boundary, manifest fields
   `cascade_engine`, `oas_dispatch_mode`, and
   `oas_internal_cascade_allowed`, plus route/cascade regression tests.
4. External Agent SDK comparison: covered by the audit's Agent-LLM-A Agent SDK,
   Google ADK, Provider-D Agents SDK, OpenClaw, and Hermes sections using the
   checked primary-source links recorded in the audit.
5. Compaction/memory/context insertion/removal: covered by audit section 5,
   manifest rows for `context_injected`, `context_compacted`,
   `event_bus_correlated`, `memory_injected`, and `memory_flushed`, and
   focused memory/context tests.
6. Product readiness judgment: this branch is shippable as a gated
   observability/reliability improvement. It is not yet a final product
  runtime guarantee because the latest-main live-like run failed with a
  structured route-capability error:
   `no_tool_capable_provider` for `tier-group.provider-k-coding-with-spark` with no candidate
   that materializes the required keeper tool support.

Completion status: not complete as a full product-readiness goal. The immediate
observability slice is useful and verified locally, and the first P0 follow-up
is now proven on live-like failed turns: provider timeout/error terminals are
normalized, no-tool-capable pre-dispatch failures stay structured, and both
are represented in the manifest/receipt chain. Still open: make the active
provider route complete with a tool-capable provider under production-like
config.

## Non-Goals

- Do not replace `Keeper_execution_receipt`; the manifest links and explains it.
- Do not move MASC world/task/governance concepts into OAS.
- Do not migrate to OAS `Complete_cascade` as part of the MVP.
- Do not build adaptive cascade ranking before the manifest proves current
  decisions.
- Do not rewrite compaction. First make compaction decisions observable as one
  stream.

## Plan Overview

| Priority | Slice | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| P0 | Runtime decision manifest MVP | One keeper turn produces one causality spine. |
| P1 | Provider-lane/tool-surface contract | Required tools are checked against actual provider lane. |
| P1 | Cascade plane invariant | Keeper path cannot accidentally switch to OAS cascade semantics. |
| P1 | Context/checkpoint SSOT cleanup | OAS checkpoint moves closer to runtime transcript SSOT. |
| P2 | Compaction/memory event unification | Add/remove/inject decisions are visible in one stream. |
| P2 | Product/operator upgrades | CLI/dashboard/replay/eval use the manifest. |

## P0: Runtime Decision Manifest MVP

### Purpose

Create a low-risk append-only artifact that links existing evidence instead of
replacing it.

### Proposed Artifact

Path:

```
$MASC_BASE_PATH/.masc/keepers/<keeper>/runtime-manifests/<trace_id>.jsonl
```

One JSONL row per decision event. The final row for a turn is terminal and
contains links to the receipt/checkpoint/tool log.

Suggested module:

- `lib/keeper/keeper_runtime_manifest.ml`
- `lib/keeper/keeper_runtime_manifest.mli`

Suggested event kinds:

- `turn_started`
- `phase_gate_decided`
- `cascade_routed`
- `pre_dispatch_blocked`
- `tool_surface_selected`
- `provider_lane_resolved`
- `provider_attempt_started`
- `provider_attempt_finished`
- `context_injected`
- `context_compacted`
- `state_snapshot_sidecar_saved`
- `working_state_sidecar_saved`
- `checkpoint_loaded`
- `checkpoint_saved`
- `receipt_appended`
- `turn_finished`

Minimal fields:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "ts": "2026-05-12T00:00:00Z",
  "keeper_name": "pm",
  "agent_name": "keeper-pm",
  "trace_id": "...",
  "generation": 12,
  "keeper_turn_id": 42,
  "oas_turn_count": 3,
  "event": "tool_surface_selected",
  "cascade_name": "tier_medium",
  "status": "ok",
  "decision": {},
  "links": {
    "receipt_path": "...",
    "checkpoint_path": "...",
    "tool_call_log_path": "..."
  }
}
```

### Implementation Order

1. Add manifest types and JSON encoding.
2. Add append helper with failure-is-observable behavior:
   - manifest append failure should increment a metric and add a coverage gap;
   - it should not initially fail the keeper turn unless the terminal receipt
     succeeds but manifest terminal row fails after P0 hardening decision.
3. Emit `turn_started` / `phase_gate_decided` / `pre_dispatch_blocked` from
   `keeper_unified_turn.ml` near existing pre-dispatch receipt sites.
4. Emit `checkpoint_loaded` from `Keeper_run_context.prepare_run_context`.
5. Emit initial `tool_surface_selected` from
   `Keeper_run_tools.prepare_agent_setup`.
6. Emit per-OAS-turn `tool_surface_selected` from the `BeforeTurnParams` hook.
7. Emit `provider_attempt_started/finished` around
   `Keeper_turn_driver_try_provider.run_try_provider`.
8. Emit `provider_lane_resolved` immediately after
   `Cascade_runner.resolve_tool_lane_for_oas_tools`.
9. Emit `checkpoint_saved` and `receipt_appended` from `Keeper_agent_run`.
10. Add a minimal CLI/read helper or dashboard endpoint that prints the chain by
    `keeper + trace_id` or `keeper + keeper_turn_id`.

### Focused Tests

Start with pure/fixture tests:

- JSON round-trip for manifest event encoding.
- Append JSONL creates valid rows and preserves order.
- Pre-dispatch blocked fixture emits terminal manifest row.
- Successful run fixture links receipt/checkpoint/tool surface fields.

Suggested focused command after implementation:

```
scripts/dune-local.sh build test/test_keeper_runtime_manifest.exe
```

If the test binary does not exist yet, add it in the same P0 slice.

## P1: Provider-Lane / Tool-Surface Contract

### Problem

The keeper hook selects visible tools and `tool_choice` before the actual
provider lane is resolved. A provider can later choose inline tools, runtime
MCP, or a reduced/no-tool lane.

### Required Product Behavior

For every tool-required turn, the product must show:

- requested tool names,
- allowed visible tool names,
- selected `tool_choice`,
- provider kind/model,
- resolved lane: `inline`, `runtime_mcp`, `public_mcp`, `none`, or mixed,
- materialized required tools,
- missing required tools after lane resolution,
- whether the contract was satisfied by an actual tool call.

### Implementation Order

1. Extend manifest `provider_lane_resolved`.
2. Extend `Keeper_execution_receipt.tool_surface` or add linked manifest-only
   fields first to avoid receipt churn.
3. In `run_try_provider`, compare required tools against effective tools after
   `resolve_tool_lane_for_oas_tools`.
4. If required tools cannot materialize, return a typed error before calling
   provider.
5. Add one regression test for required tool + provider without tool support.

## P1: Cascade Plane Invariant

### Problem

MASC and OAS both have cascade concepts. Keeper runtime must not silently drift
from MASC cascade semantics into OAS `Complete_cascade`.

### Implementation Order

1. Add a typed `Keeper_cascade_engine` value near
   `Keeper_turn_driver.run_named`.
2. Record the engine id and OAS dispatch mode in runtime-manifest decision
   rows.
3. Add a test/grep guard that keeper hot path does not call
   `Llm_provider.Complete_cascade.complete_cascade`.
4. Document migration requirements if this invariant is ever intentionally
   changed:
   - health tracker,
   - admission queue,
   - fallback observation,
   - receipt fields,
   - dashboard semantics,
   - tool/provider lane semantics.

## P1: Context / Checkpoint SSOT Cleanup

### Problem

Runtime transcript truth is split:

- MASC `working_context`,
- OAS `Agent.state.messages`,
- OAS checkpoint,
- raw `[STATE]` text,
- MASC memory bank,
- receipt/checkpoint sidecars.

### Near-Term Direction

Do not rewrite all context logic at once. First reduce ambiguity:

1. Manifest records context source hashes:
   - base system prompt,
   - dynamic context,
   - memory context,
   - temporal context,
   - history message count/hash,
   - checkpoint before/after ids.
2. Store structured state in the OAS checkpoint; sidecars are runtime evidence,
   not checkpoint recovery input.
3. Treat raw `[STATE]` as a display/compatibility input, not the only durable
   continuity source.
4. Pick one small code path where MASC no longer re-derives state from raw text
   if the structured sidecar exists.

## P2: Compaction / Memory Event Unification

### Problem

Compaction and memory decisions are real, but currently spread across:

- pre-dispatch checkpoint hygiene,
- OAS proactive compaction,
- OAS emergency compaction,
- memory hook injection,
- memory hook flush,
- post-run checkpoint patching,
- deterministic memory bank writes.

### Product Behavior

The operator should be able to answer:

- What was injected?
- What was summarized?
- What was dropped?
- What was relocated?
- What was reloaded from memory?
- What checkpoint contains the surviving context?

### Implementation Order

1. Add manifest events for current compaction/memory points without changing
   behavior. Current branch covers pre-dispatch compaction decisions and
   OAS Event_bus compaction/overflow summaries.
2. Add memory hook injection/flush summaries to the same causal stream.
   Current branch records `memory_injected` and `memory_flushed`.
3. Add a compaction summary view keyed by `trace_id`.
4. Add quality metrics later:
   - before/after tokens,
   - required marker/state preserved,
   - tool-result pair preserved,
   - next-turn continuity success.

## P2: Product Upgrades After P0/P1

Only after the manifest exists:

- CLI replay: `masc trace-runtime <keeper> <turn_id|trace_id>`.
- Dashboard turn inspector: phase/cascade/tool/context/checkpoint/receipt tabs.
- Offline eval for tool selection quality.
- Compaction quality benchmark.
- Adaptive cascade ranking using observed latency/cost/health, not static theory.

## First Concrete PR Sequence

1. `docs(goal): record keeper runtime truth unification plan`
   - this document and parent audit only.
2. `feat(keeper): add runtime manifest schema and JSONL append`
   - pure module, tests, no behavior change.
3. `feat(keeper): emit manifest for pre-dispatch and receipt paths`
   - phase gate/cascade blocked/success terminal links.
4. `feat(keeper): record provider lane and tool surface in manifest`
   - no new fail-loud yet; observe first.
5. `fix(keeper): fail required-tool turns when provider lane cannot materialize`
   - behavior change after observation proves shape.
6. `feat(keeper): type and expose the keeper/OAS cascade boundary`
   - invariant hardening plus manifest-visible dispatch mode.
7. `feat(keeper): context/compaction decision events`
   - unify context evidence.
