# Keeper Tool Boundary Matrix

Status: P0 ratchet source for keeper agent tool boundaries.
Last updated: 2026-05-25.

This matrix freezes the owner map for keeper modules that participate in the
agent tool path. A new file in scope must be added here with exactly one owner
category before it can land.

Audit command:

```bash
scripts/audit-keeper-tool-boundary-matrix.sh
```

Scope:

```text
^lib/keeper/keeper_(gh|hooks|sandbox|exec|shell|tool|tools)[^/]*\.mli?$
```

## Owner Categories

| Owner | Responsibility | Must not own |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `execution-dispatch` | Keeper-side command, board, status, task, persona, memory, and receipt execution dispatch. | Tool name policy, sandbox runtime mechanics, GitHub transport details. |
| `hook-observation` | OAS hook event parsing, metrics, and observational adapters. | OAS tool handler execution or keeper runtime dispatch. |
| `oas-tool-bridge` | Keeper tool bridge for OAS bundle, handler, telemetry, JSON, markers, workflow, and deterministic errors. | Generic tool policy or non-OAS hook observation. |
| `sandbox-runtime` | Sandbox containment, Docker runtime, read/session runners, executor, and shell IR target plumbing. | Tool naming policy or GitHub runtime. |
| `shell-surface` | Shell command parsing, typed Execute input, shell ops, path, readonly policy, runtime paths, and timeout semantics. | Sandbox runtime or keeper tool registry/policy. |
| `tool-surface-policy` | Keeper tool aliasing, boundary, disclosure, diversity, emission, registry, policy, resolution, and tool-specific policy records. | OAS bridge implementation, shell parsing, sandbox execution. |

## Coverage Manifest
