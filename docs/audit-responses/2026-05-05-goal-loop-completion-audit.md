# Audit Response — 2026-05-05 GOAL LOOP Completion Audit

## Source

- **Input**: user-supplied GOAL LOOP integration design titled
  `Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act -> Verify`, 작성일 2026-05-05.
- **Scope**: original sections 0-9, including startup-log reproduction,
  Observe/Orient/Decide/Act/Verify wiring, dashboard, anti-stagnation rules,
  and expected convergence.
- **Purpose**: completion audit only. This document does **not** mark the loop
  complete. It freezes what is already shipped on `main`, what is still only a
  deterministic fixture, and what still has no ACT artifact.

  PASS evidence for source manifest coverage, source artifact validation,
  source identity,
  aggregate claim source verification, aggregate reconciliation, strict
  source/catalog ID sync, broader structured-ID ownership triage, and
  post-ACT Verify. The row-corpus discovery manifest is attached as evidence
  for the strict blocker; it records the 12 prompt documents checked, 19
  strict itemized IDs, 187 missing rows, 72 broader uncataloged structured IDs,
  260 broader source occurrences, duplicate checked 47-issue audit artifacts
  that do not contain the missing 206-row corpus, and an independent cascade
  completion report that keeps #13265 open because the corpus is not
  replayable. A design research note with aggregate 206/STILL_PRESENT claims
  and a single `R-FATAL-1` example was also checked and does not contain the
  missing row corpus. The closest GOAL-loop export archive was checked as
  well; it contains the same prompt documents and research notes, with no
  `source_catalog_id`, strict-row schema, or 206 itemized rows. A workspace/tmp
  sweep checked 16 generated JSON artifacts mentioning the catalog id; those
  were Orient/status/catalog snapshots with 18 or 19 rows, not a complete
  strict 206-row corpus. A Kimi keeper spec archive with an older GOAL LOOP
  fixture/script snapshot was also checked and has no `source_catalog_id`,
  `expected_findings_total`, strict-row schema, or 206-row corpus artifact in
  its goal-loop members. A broader filename-level sweep of 43 Downloads zip
  archives matching Kimi/audit/goal/keeper/masc found no `source_catalog_id`,
  `corpus_id`, `expected_findings_total`, strict-row marker, or GOAL LOOP
  catalog-id marker in text-like archive members. A non-archive text-like
  Downloads sweep also checked 13,031 files, including 10,848 files in
  Kimi/audit/goal/keeper/masc paths, and found 0 strict-corpus marker hits; the
  17 near-miss files carried only aggregate/examples or unrelated field names.
  Standalone docx and PDF sweeps checked 43 docx files and 91 PDF files; there
  were 0 strict-corpus marker hits, and the two unreadable PDFs were not in
  Kimi/audit/goal/keeper/masc paths. A standalone spreadsheet sweep checked 24
  xlsx/xls files and found 0 marker hits; no spreadsheet paths matched
  Kimi/audit/goal/keeper/masc. A local MASC runtime sweep indexed 118,911
  files and found 0 strict-corpus marker hits; the 20 corpus-named runtime
  paths were ordinary repo script copies, not GOAL LOOP strict row artifacts.
  A top-level temp sweep checked 2,880 files in `/tmp` and `/private/tmp`; it
  found 37 marker files, all PR/issue notes, helper scripts, or
  Orient/status/audit snapshots, with 0 candidate 206-row JSON corpora and a
  maximum observed JSON finding count of 19.

  and mirrored in `test/fixtures/goal_loop/row-corpus-discovery.external-claim.json`
  as `prompt_source_docs_explicit_row_candidate_inventory`; the inventory now
  accounts for the prompt-source split explicitly, with 5 files contributing
  candidates and 7 checked prompt files yielding zero explicit candidate rows.
  Those 7 files are not empty: the inventory separately records 897
  unstructured headings, table rows, numbered items, and bullet items that are
  not stable strict-corpus rows and therefore cannot satisfy the 206-row gate.
  All 7 no-row marker buckets carry tracking refs to #13265 and #13636. The
  inventory also evaluates source currentness at `checked_at=2026-05-06`: it
  records 7 future-dated claims, classifies future due dates and forecast dates
  separately, and blocks currentness on 3 future-dated source snapshot/report
  claims in `artifact_synthesis.md`, `audit_derived_state.md`, and
  `progress-evaluation.md`.

  confidence High: exits non-zero with two closeout blockers:
  `strict_row_level_catalog_complete` and
  `prompt_requirements_closeout_complete`. The strict row evidence directly
  records the source-row candidate inventory as 132/206 and validates the 5/7
  source-file coverage split with no unaccounted prompt source files. The 7
  no-row files carry 897 unstructured requirement markers, but those markers
  are tracked as non-corpus evidence and do not satisfy the strict row gate.
  Completion-audit evidence validates all 7 no-row marker buckets have tracking
  refs and reports 2 unique tracking issue refs (#13265 and #13636). The
  source-row inventory currentness block is structurally validated too:
  `future_date_claims_total=7`,
  `blocking_future_date_claims_total=3`, and
  `source_currentness_current=false`. The
  checklist maps all 21 prompt requirements to concrete artifacts and blockers
  across all 12 prompt source documents: 5 `PASS`, 14 `PARTIAL`, and 2
  `BLOCKED` requirements, with all 16 non-PASS rows carrying valid GitHub issue
  tracking refs. The prompt checklist also validates that all `artifact_refs`
  resolve to repo-local files after optional `#...` anchors are stripped; user
  local paths, path escapes, and missing artifact files make the checklist
  unrecorded. Anchored refs must also resolve to anchor text present in the
  target file.

  prompt objective from being marked complete while the recorded checklist
  still has 14 `PARTIAL` and 2 `BLOCKED` prompt requirements. The
  `prompt_to_artifact_checklist_recorded` criterion remains `PASS`, with 21
  unique requirement IDs, 12 unique issue refs, and no missing or invalid
  tracking refs; recording the map is separate from satisfying every mapped
  prompt requirement.

- [근거] `python3 test/test_goal_loop_completion_audit.py` checked at
  2026-05-06T16:03:11+09:00, confidence High: the completion audit accepts
  optional `--strict-row-corpus` and `--source-row-candidate-inventory`
  artifacts, validates catalog identity and internal totals, and still does not
  use either artifact as a proxy for completion. A synthetic valid 206-row
  corpus is recorded as `validated=true`, while the explicit source-row
  inventory is recorded as 132/206 with the 5 source files that contain
  candidates and 7 checked source files that do not. The same inventory now
  proves that those 7 no-row files contain 897 unstructured requirement markers
  rather than stable row IDs, and requires those marker buckets to carry valid
  tracking issue refs; the closeout remains `BLOCKED` while Orient still
  reports only 19 itemized rows. Invalid supplied
  corpora or inconsistent source-row inventories block
  `strict_row_level_catalog_complete`. The same test suite now verifies that a
  recorded prompt checklist is not itself a completion proxy: the separate
  `prompt_requirements_closeout_complete` criterion fails while any mapped
  requirement remains `PARTIAL` or `BLOCKED`, passes only when every mapped
  requirement is `PASS`, and rejects incomplete rows that lack valid GitHub
  issue tracking refs. It also rejects prompt checklist rows whose
  `artifact_refs` are missing, invalid, user-local, or not backed by repo-local
  files, and rejects anchored refs whose anchor text is absent from the target
  artifact.

  `external_sources` fails with

  confidence High: Orient now accepts the same optional `--strict-row-corpus`
  artifact and uses it as the strict catalog basis only after validation. A
  valid synthetic 206-row corpus makes Orient report `audit_catalog=COMPLETE`
  with 206 itemized rows, `source_itemized_id_basis=strict_row_corpus`, and
  zero missing rows; invalid corpora keep the existing 19-row catalog
  incomplete. Aggregate GOAL LOOP status carries the strict-row corpus metadata
  so closeout evidence can distinguish source-document itemized IDs from a
  complete row-corpus artifact.

  19 unique audit IDs, but the underlying prompt source artifacts are not yet
  replayable from the repository because `--require-source-artifacts` fails.

## Current Completion State

| Area | Status | Reason |
|------|--------|--------|
| Deterministic GOAL LOOP replay | **PARTIAL** | Fixture bundle exists and proves the loop stays critical, but it is not live production ingestion. |
| Provider health skip ACT | **PARTIAL** | #13124 adds provider probe ACT artifact; the post-ACT event/transition replay has no GOAL LOOP signature matches, but the full 206-row corpus is still absent. |
| Alive-but-stuck recovery ACT | **PARTIAL** | #13123 adds recovery side effect; #13126 adds timeout phase diagnostics. Runtime recovery success SLO remains unproven. |
| Keeper TOML unknown-key visibility | **PARTIAL** | #13138 surfaces unknown keys in health; strict schema rejection is not yet enforced. |
| Governance fallback visibility | **PARTIAL** | #13143 exposes fallback counters; strict judge-output failure policy is not complete. |
| Slot forced reclaim + credential auto-recovery | **PARTIAL** | `D-EMERGENCY-1` now has linked ACT PRs in `act-map.startup.json`; the current post-ACT event/transition window verifies clean for strict GOAL LOOP signatures. |
| Full 206-finding Orient engine | **NOT PROVEN** | Orient can now replay the external claim catalog, but the checked artifacts itemize only 19 of the claimed 206 findings. |
| Full Verify pipeline | **PARTIAL** | `verify.fail.json` intentionally keeps the startup replay red; a separate live post-ACT event/transition replay now passes for the 19 strict itemized IDs. |

## Prompt-to-Artifact Checklist

This checklist is the closeout map from the prompt requirements to concrete
repo or runtime evidence. A `PASS` here means the requirement has direct
evidence; `PARTIAL` means a concrete artifact exists but does not cover the
full prompt requirement; `BLOCKED` means the next required input is outside the
current repo evidence. The machine-readable mirror is
`test/fixtures/goal_loop/prompt-closeout-checklist.external-claim.json`, and
`goal_loop_completion_audit.py --prompt-closeout-checklist` validates that it
is catalog-bound, covers all 12 prompt sources, has no local path leaks, and
keeps the strict corpus blocker explicit. The machine checklist mirrors all 21
rows below and requires every `PARTIAL` or `BLOCKED` row to carry at least one
GitHub issue tracking ref.

| Prompt requirement | Concrete artifact or command | Status |
|--------------------|------------------------------|--------|
| 0-1 provider health skipped across providers/models | `observe.startup.json`, `orient.startup.json`, `NF-1` in `audit-corpus.external-claim.json` | PARTIAL: startup signature is replayed; full 55-model row corpus is absent. |
| 0-2 keeper credential starvation/archival | `observe.startup.json`, `orient.startup.json`, `NF-2`, linked ACT map entries | PARTIAL: signature and ACT links exist; full keeper recovery SLO is not proven. |
| 0-3 alive-but-stuck supervisor recovery failure | `NF-3`, #13123/#13126 references, post-ACT Verify metadata | PARTIAL: failure is modeled; runtime recovery success across all keepers is not proven. |
| 0-4 governance unparseable/lenient fallback | `NF-4`, #13143 references | PARTIAL: visibility exists; strict judge-output failure policy is incomplete. |
| 0-5 keeper TOML unknown keys | `NF-6`, #13138 references | PARTIAL: health visibility exists; strict schema rejection is not enforced. |
| 0-6 dashboard metric all-zero | startup fixture, audit catalog examples, Observe metric contract, alerts, Grafana dashboard, validator and tests | PASS for all-zero Observe metric detection coverage. |
| 0-7 linear autoboot warmup | `NF-5` source reference in catalog boundary | PARTIAL: source claim is tracked; no full row-level replay. |
| 1 GOAL LOOP Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act -> Verify | `scripts/observe_goal_loop_logs.py`, `scripts/orient_goal_loop_logs.py`, `scripts/decide_goal_loop_findings.py`, `scripts/verify_goal_loop_logs.py`, `scripts/goal_loop_status.py`, `scripts/goal_loop_scheduler.py`, scheduler tests and runtime scheduler docs | PASS for scheduler cadence and Verify-fail Observe re-entry coverage. |
| 2-1 `observe.yml` Prometheus/Grafana metrics | `observe_goal_loop_logs.py`, fixture metrics, audit response, Observe metric contract, alerts, Grafana dashboard, validator and tests | PASS for the required Observe metric/alert/dashboard contract coverage. |
| 2-2 `observe_logs.py` pattern parser | `scripts/observe_goal_loop_logs.py`, `test/test_observe_goal_loop_logs.py` | PASS for deterministic parser coverage. |
| 3-1 `orient.ml` audit comparison engine | `scripts/orient_goal_loop_logs.py`, `audit-corpus.external-claim.json`, `structured-id-triage.external-claim.json` | PARTIAL: engine and triage exist; only 19/206 strict rows are itemized. |
| 3-2 Orient dashboard counts | `scripts/goal_loop_status.py`, `/api/v1/dashboard/goal-loop/status`, `GoalLoopPanel` tests | PASS for operator panel rendering audit catalog counts and missing-row blockers from runtime status JSON. |
| 4-1 priority decision algorithm | `scripts/decide_goal_loop_findings.py`, `test/test_decide_goal_loop_findings.py` | PASS for fixture-based decision ranking. |
| 4-2 weekly ACT priority queue | `act-map.startup.json`, `known-prs.startup.json`, `validate_goal_loop_act_map.py` | PARTIAL: reference integrity exists; SLA ownership workflow is not automatic. |
| 5 ACT checklist/PR proof | linked PR references in `act-map.startup.json` plus ACT validation | PARTIAL: known ACTs are mapped; not every still-present row has a row-level ACT because 187 rows are missing. |
| 6-1 `verify.yml` unit/regression/TLA/log/metric/orient gates | `scripts/verify_goal_loop_logs.py`, `goal_loop_completion_audit.py`, focused tests | PARTIAL: closeout verifier exists; TLA and production metric gates are not fully implemented. |
| 6-2 Verify PASS/FAIL branch | `verify.fail.json`, post-ACT live Verify snapshot, completion audit criteria | PARTIAL: branch semantics exist; complete corpus Verify is blocked. |
| 7 GOAL LOOP dashboard | `/api/v1/dashboard/goal-loop/status`, Monitoring `GOAL LOOP` nav, `GoalLoopPanel` tests | PASS for read-refresh dashboard integration. Strict corpus and live SLO proof remain blocked in their own rows. |
| 8 anti-stagnation rules | ACT reference guard and completion audit blocker | PARTIAL: reference integrity exists; SLA timers/escalation are not implemented. |
| 9 expected convergence after week/month | completion audit and #13265 | BLOCKED: no measured convergence claim is valid without the strict corpus and live SLO proof. |
| Full 206-row strict corpus | `row-corpus-discovery.external-claim.json`, `strict-row-corpus-contract.json`, `--strict-row-corpus` path | BLOCKED: 24 searches/inventories checked; `FULL_ROW_CORPUS_NOT_FOUND`, 19/206 strict rows, 187 strict rows missing. The source-doc explicit-row extractor finds only 132/206 candidate rows across 5 source files, with 7 checked prompt files yielding zero explicit candidates, and cannot close the strict corpus gap. Those 7 no-row files contain 897 unstructured requirement markers that remain non-corpus evidence. Candidate strict rows must also cite catalog external sources and line refs within catalog line counts. |

## Section-by-Section Audit

### 0. Live Startup Log Reproduction

**Claimed requirement**: server-startup logs reproduce the 206-finding audit:
provider health skipped, credential starvation, alive-but-stuck, governance
fallback, unknown TOML keys, all-zero metrics, linear warmup.

**Shipped**:

- `test/fixtures/goal_loop/observe.startup.json`
- `test/fixtures/goal_loop/orient.startup.json`
- `test/fixtures/goal_loop/verify.fail.json`
- `test/fixtures/goal_loop/audit-corpus.external-claim.json`
- `docs/examples/goal-loop-fixture.md`

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

The fixture pins concrete startup evidence for NF-1, NF-2, NF-3, NF-4, and
NF-6. The external claim catalog itemizes 19 finding IDs from the supplied
documents and records all 12 prompt-supplied source paths. It now reconciles
the aggregate-count mismatch: the 214 integrated total is represented as the
206 baseline audit corpus plus 8 live-log `NEW_FINDING` items. It does not yet
prove the full row-level aggregate from live production state; 187 rows remain
missing from the 206-itemized corpus, the 214 claim has no row-level corpus,
and several prompt claims remain evidence-absent in the fixture (`NF-5`,
`NF-7`, `NF-8`, `R-FATAL-1`, `CF-1`). The required row-corpus shape is now
machine-checkable via `--strict-row-corpus`, and Orient now has a first-class
path to ingest that artifact before the strict catalog criterion can pass.

**Verification command**:

```bash
python3 scripts/goal_loop_status.py \
  --observe-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/observe.startup.json \
  --orient-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/orient.startup.json \
  --decide-json /tmp/goal-loop-decide.json \
  --verify-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/verify.fail.json \
  --loop-iteration "#fixture" \
  --format text
```

**206-claim catalog guard**:

```bash
python3 scripts/orient_goal_loop_logs.py \
  test/fixtures/goal_loop/observe.startup.json \
  --audit-catalog test/fixtures/goal_loop/audit-corpus.external-claim.json \
  --require-complete-catalog
```

This command must fail until the full 206-row corpus is attached or checked in.

### 1. GOAL LOOP Architecture

**Claimed requirement**: Observe -> Orient -> Decide -> Act -> Verify loop with
FAIL re-entry and phase cadence.

**Shipped**:

- `scripts/observe_goal_loop_logs.py`
- `scripts/orient_goal_loop_logs.py`
- `scripts/decide_goal_loop_findings.py`
- `scripts/verify_goal_loop_logs.py`
- `scripts/goal_loop_status.py`
- `test/test_goal_loop_status.py`

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

The deterministic phase chain exists. Cadence scheduling (5s Observe, 1m
Orient, 1h Decide, 1d Act, 5m Verify) is not yet implemented as a long-running
runtime loop.

### 2. OBSERVE

**Claimed requirement**: Prometheus/Grafana metrics plus automated log-pattern
parsing.

**Shipped**:

- Startup-log pattern replay via `observe_goal_loop_logs.py`.
- Fixture coverage for provider-health skipped, credential archived
  starvation, alive-but-stuck, governance fallback, and unknown config keys.

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

The log parser path exists. The complete Prometheus metric set from the prompt
is not fully implemented as runtime metrics, and live scrape/dashboard
evidence is still required before this can be marked PASS.

### 3. ORIENT

**Claimed requirement**: automated comparison between audit findings and
current runtime/code state, including 206 findings.

**Shipped**:

- `orient_goal_loop_logs.py` classifies startup findings into
  `EVIDENCE_PRESENT` and `EVIDENCE_ABSENT`.
- `orient.startup.json` produces 10 deterministic finding rows.
- `audit-corpus.external-claim.json` lets Orient replay the itemized portion of
  the external 206-finding claim and exposes the missing itemized rows.

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

The Orient skeleton is testable, and the prompt's external 206/214 aggregate
claims are now both machine-visible and reconciled as 206 baseline findings
plus 8 live-log new findings. The full row-level set is still not encoded:
current
catalog replay reports 12/12 source documents named by the manifest, no checked
source artifacts for the logical `prompt_corpus/GOAL_LOOP/...` paths, local
external source artifacts resolvable from `<GOAL_LOOP_SOURCE_ROOT>` via
`--audit-source-strip-prefix`, 19 source-itemized IDs matching the 19
catalog-itemized findings, 6/6 aggregate claim source checks verified from
resolved documents, 1/1 aggregate reconciliation verified, 12/12 source
identity checks verified against checked SHA-256 and line-count metadata, 91
broader structured source IDs with 72 not in the strict audit catalog across 12
uncataloged ID families and 260 source occurrences, 187 missing 206-itemized
rows, row-corpus discovery evidence showing the checked 47-issue audit
artifacts and duplicates are not the missing 206-row corpus, an independent
report that confirms the #13265 replay gap remains open, and a 43-archive
Downloads marker sweep with zero strict-corpus marker hits. There are still 9
itemized rows that are not evaluable from the startup log patterns.
`goal_loop_completion_audit.py --require-complete` turns those facts into a
closeout gate so the objective cannot be marked complete while those blockers
remain.

### 4. DECIDE

**Claimed requirement**: priority algorithm and concrete P0/P1/P2 decision
queue.

**Shipped**:

- `decide_goal_loop_findings.py` maps evidence-present findings to:
  `D-EMERGENCY-1`, `D-EMERGENCY-2`, `D-P1-1`, `D-P1-2`, `D-P2-1`, `D-P2-2`.
- `act-map.startup.json` links all five startup evidence-present decisions to
  real PR artifacts.
- `validate_goal_loop_act_map.py` verifies PR-shaped ACT artifacts.

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

The priority queue is deterministic and the startup ACT map is fully linked.
Decide still cannot be considered complete for the original 206-finding claim
because several itemized catalog findings have no source decision mapping and
the full 206-row corpus is absent.

### 5. ACT

**Claimed requirement**: code implementation and PR merge for the selected
decisions.

| Decision | Finding | ACT status | Evidence |
|----------|---------|------------|----------|
| `D-EMERGENCY-1` | `NF-2` credential archived starvation | **LINKED** | #13218 credential auto-recovery, #13231 slot forced-reclaim regression, #13246 crash-path force release. |
| `D-EMERGENCY-2` | `NF-1` provider health skipped | **LINKED** | #13124 `fix: probe local providers in cascade catalog`. |
| `D-P1-1` | `NF-3`, `R-FATAL-1` recovery/fallback | **LINKED** | #13123 recovery side effect, #13126 timeout phase diagnostics. |
| `D-P1-2` | `CF-1` pricing catalog miss | **NOT QUEUED IN FIXTURE** | `CF-1` is `EVIDENCE_ABSENT` in `orient.startup.json`; needs live-pricing audit if seen again. |
| `D-P2-1` | `NF-6` unknown keeper TOML keys | **LINKED** | #13138 health visibility. |
| `D-P2-2` | `NF-4` governance fallback | **LINKED** | #13143 fallback counters. |

**Status**: **PARTIAL**. All startup evidence-present decisions are linked to
ACT PRs, and the current post-ACT event/transition replay has no strict GOAL
LOOP signature matches. The external 206-finding corpus is still not fully
mapped to ACT decisions.

### 6. VERIFY

**Claimed requirement**: unit tests, regression tests, TLA+ checks, production
log verification, metric verification, and Orient re-check.

**Shipped**:

- Deterministic fixture replay.
- Regression tests for Decide/status/ACT-map validation.
- `verify.fail.json` that keeps the loop red.
- Verify reports can carry post-ACT evidence metadata, including explicit
  evidence-window bounds, and
  `goal_loop_completion_audit.py` requires that metadata before accepting a
  Verify `PASS` as closeout evidence.

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

The startup fixture still contains `NF-2` evidence and remains red by design.
A separate live post-ACT event/transition replay now passes with
`post_act_verify=true`, accepted live-runtime `evidence_kind`, concrete
`evidence_source`, `evidence_window_start`, `evidence_window_end`, and
`checked_at` metadata. This clears the post-ACT Verify closeout criterion for
the current strict 19-ID catalog, but not the missing 187 row-level findings.

### 7. GOAL LOOP Dashboard

**Claimed requirement**: unified real-time dashboard showing phase state,
system health, next action, and counts.

**Shipped**:

- `goal_loop_status.py` emits the compact phase status and next action.
- Current `goal_loop_status.py` prefers `ACT_MISSING` / `ACT_UNMAPPED`
  decisions over already-linked decisions when choosing `next_action`.
- Verify status now preserves violation kinds, including
  `post_act_verify_pending`, so stale fixture replays remain visibly distinct
  from live post-ACT evidence.
- Verify status also preserves optional post-ACT evidence metadata so the
  completion audit can distinguish a real post-ACT replay from a synthetic
  green status file.
- When `goal_loop_status.py` receives catalog-enriched Orient JSON, it carries
  the audit catalog summary into `phases.orient.summary.audit_catalog` and
  keeps Orient at least `warning` while the catalog is incomplete or has open
  consistency findings.
- `docs/examples/goal-loop-fixture.md` documents text and JSON status replay.

**Status**: **PASS for dashboard integration**.

The operator dashboard now exposes a Monitoring `GOAL LOOP` section wired
through `/api/v1/dashboard/goal-loop/status`. The panel reads runtime
`status.json`, shows phase summaries, audit catalog counts, strict-corpus
blockers, next action, and Verify evidence, and pins those states in component
tests. This is a read-refresh dashboard surface; strict corpus completion and
live recovery SLO proof remain separate blockers above.

### 8. Anti-Stagnation

**Claimed requirement**: every `STILL_PRESENT` finding must have ACT, ACT must
be created within 48h, Verify within 24h, failure within 4h, and week-old
findings escalate.

**Shipped**:

- #13178 adds an ACT-reference guard so artifact strings cannot silently point
  to nonexistent PR numbers.
- `--require-complete-catalog` explicitly fails while the claimed 206-finding
  corpus is not fully itemized.

**Status**: **PARTIAL**.

Reference integrity is guarded. SLA timers, automatic escalation, and
merge/rollback enforcement are not implemented.

### 9. Expected Convergence

**Claimed requirement**: after one week, keepers/providers/throughput should be
healthy and `STILL_PRESENT < 20`; after one month, `STILL_PRESENT = 0`.

**Status**: **NOT PROVEN**.

No convergence claim is valid yet. The only safe current statement is:

- The deterministic fixture still reports overall critical.
- Five startup ACT decisions are linked and merged.
- The external 206-finding claim is not fully itemized in repo-local evidence.
- Live runtime replay is required before any "fixed" or "healthy" claim.

## Next Concrete ACT

1. Attach or check in the full row-level audit corpus. The current
   `audit-corpus.external-claim.json` records all 12 prompt source paths,
   four aggregate claims, one resolved 206+8=214 aggregate reconciliation, one
   resolved consistency finding, and 19 itemized findings, but
   `--require-complete-catalog` still fails with 187 missing rows against the
   206 claim. The aggregate claims are now source-verified at 6/6 and
   reconciled at 1/1, so the remaining catalog gap is row-level completeness,
   not whether the aggregate numbers appear in the supplied documents. The
   checked row-corpus discovery manifest records that the known 47-issue audit
   artifacts and duplicates are not the missing corpus, and that the cascade
   completion report still lists #13265 as open. It also records broader
   Downloads, runtime, temp, GitHub, local-history, full Downloads CLI,
   source-doc-only CLI, tar/gzip compressed-container discovery sweeps, and
   a source-doc explicit-row candidate inventory; these are evidence for the
   blocker, not a substitute for the rows.
2. Decide whether the source artifacts should be checked in under
   `prompt_corpus/GOAL_LOOP/...` or kept external. Local external validation
   passes via `<GOAL_LOOP_SOURCE_ROOT>` plus `--audit-source-strip-prefix`, and
   the checked digest manifest proves source identity, but public-repo replay
   still needs a stable non-user-local artifact distribution policy.
3. Re-run Orient against the complete corpus without changing code and update
   the replay counts in this audit.
4. Refresh the post-ACT Verify artifact whenever new ACT PRs merge or the live
   runtime restarts, using `--post-act-verify`, accepted live-runtime
   `--evidence-kind`, concrete `--evidence-source`,
   `--evidence-window-start`, `--evidence-window-end`, and `--checked-at`.
5. Keep the dashboard fixture's critical state pinned in UI tests when the
   status schema changes.
6. Add SLA state for anti-stagnation after ACT coverage is complete; otherwise
   timers will only escalate known missing work without changing recovery.

## Do-Not-Close Rule

Do not mark the GOAL LOOP objective complete while any of these are true:

- `verify.fail.json` is the latest Verify fixture.
- The full 206-finding audit corpus is not replayed by Orient with
  `--require-complete-catalog` passing.
- The catalog source paths are not replayed from a stable agreed artifact root
  with `--require-source-artifacts` passing.
- The replayed external artifact root does not match the checked SHA-256 and
  line-count identity manifest.
- The aggregate reconciliation stops passing with
  `--require-consistency-resolved`.
- Live runtime evidence is not re-collected after the ACT PRs are merged.
- The latest Verify `PASS` for the relevant runtime window lacks
  `post_act_verify=true`, an accepted live-runtime `evidence_kind`, a concrete
  `evidence_source`, explicit evidence-window bounds, or `checked_at`.
