# GOAL LOOP fixture replay

This fixture bundle is a local, deterministic replay of the startup evidence
used by the GOAL LOOP tooling tests.  It proves that Observe, Orient, Decide,
Act linkage, Verify, and aggregate status stay wired together without needing a
live production log.

Run from the repository root:

```bash
python3 scripts/decide_goal_loop_findings.py \
  test/fixtures/goal_loop/orient.startup.json \
  --act-map test/fixtures/goal_loop/act-map.startup.json \
  > /tmp/goal-loop-decide.json

python3 scripts/goal_loop_status.py \
  --observe-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/observe.startup.json \
  --orient-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/orient.startup.json \
  --decide-json /tmp/goal-loop-decide.json \
  --verify-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/verify.fail.json \
  --loop-iteration "#fixture" \
  --format text
```

Expected key facts:

- `overall_status` is `critical`.
- Decide reports `act_linked_count=5` and `act_missing_count=0`.
- Act is no longer critical in the fixture: every startup decision has at least
  one linked PR artifact.
- Verify remains `FAIL` because the startup replay is pre-ACT evidence, so the
  loop must not be marked complete until a post-ACT live verify passes.

Use the JSON status form when another tool needs to consume the replay:

```bash
python3 scripts/goal_loop_status.py \
  --observe-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/observe.startup.json \
  --orient-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/orient.startup.json \
  --decide-json /tmp/goal-loop-decide.json \
  --verify-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/verify.fail.json \
  --loop-iteration "#fixture"
```

Validate that the fixture's ACT artifacts point at known PR numbers:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_goal_loop_act_map.py \
  test/fixtures/goal_loop/act-map.startup.json \
  --known-prs-json test/fixtures/goal_loop/known-prs.startup.json \
  --require-pr-ref \
  --fail-on any
```

For live validation, capture a current PR snapshot first and pass that file as
`--known-prs-json`.

Replay with an explicit finding catalog when testing a larger audit corpus:

```bash
python3 scripts/orient_goal_loop_logs.py \
  test/fixtures/goal_loop/observe.startup.json \
  --finding-catalog test/fixtures/goal_loop/finding-catalog.sample.json \
  --format text
```

The catalog accepts either a top-level JSON array or an object with
`findings`.  Each finding requires `finding_id`, `title`, `severity`, and
`patterns`.  A full audit corpus, including the 206-finding production-audit
set, can use the same format without changing the Orient script.
