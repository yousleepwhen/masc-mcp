## 1. Problem

After RFC-0058 §9 (Phase 9.1–9.4) eliminated the on-disk `cascade.json`, the codebase still carries a *legacy catalog discovery* path that scans flat `<profile>_models` JSON keys emitted by the materializer's per-profile fallback layout. Production `cascade.toml` has migrated entirely to the declarative `[providers.X]` / `[tier-group.X]` namespaces; the legacy `Cascade_config_loader.load_catalog` returns `[]` on every production read.

The mismatch causes a known production divergence:

| Layer | Production result | Test result (per-profile fixture) |
|---|---|---|
| `Cascade_catalog_runtime` (declarative path) | `"primary"` (live snapshot) | `"primary"` (legacy reader sees flat key) |
| `Keeper_config.default_cascade_name` (legacy path, init-time cached) | `"default"` (catalog empty at init) | `"primary"` |

18 production call sites of `Keeper_config.default_cascade_name` therefore reference a stale fallback that has no corresponding entry in the live catalog: `Keeper_turn_cascade_budget` comparisons never match, `Keeper_turn_up_create/update` defaults to an invalid cascade name, `Dashboard_cascade` advertises a non-existent profile in `config_path` defaults, and so on. Six Pattern C test failures in PR #14620 are the visible symptom; #14624 documents the layered cause.

A surgical fix (route `Keeper_config.default_cascade_name` through `Cascade_catalog_runtime`) does not close the gap: `lookup_active_profile` falls back to `normalize_declared_name` which calls `cascade_name_for_use`, which itself reads the legacy catalog. The mismatch survives unless the legacy path is removed.

### Goal

Delete `Cascade_config_loader.load_catalog` / `load_profile_weighted` / `load_profile` and their `<profile>_models` materializer arm. Migrate every reader to `Cascade_catalog_runtime` (the live snapshot, declarative-aware). Treat the declarative schema as the sole catalog source of truth.

### Non-goals

- Changing the dashboard UX or any operator-visible behavior. The transition should be invisible at runtime.
- Touching the SDK / hook / agent boundary contracts.
- Renaming RFC-0058 namespaces or fields. The migration only deletes the *legacy reader*, not the declarative schema.

## 2. Current state

### 2.1 Legacy catalog API

`lib/cascade/cascade_config_loader.ml`:
- `load_catalog : config_path:string -> (catalog_entry list, string) result` — scans `<name>_models` keys at the root of the materialized JSON.
- `load_profile_weighted : config_path:string -> name:string -> weighted_entry list` — pulls the `<name>_models` array, parses each item.
- `load_profile : config_path:string -> name:string -> string list` — derived from `load_profile_weighted`.
- The removed per-profile bridge converted flat keys into `Cascade_ref.cascade_profile`.
- `is_deprecated_logical_profile_name` — retired; catalog discovery no longer
  hides route-alias-shaped profile names.

`lib/cascade/cascade_toml_materializer.ml:404`:
- Per-profile field arm `models = [...]` → JSON `<profile>_models = [...]`. Emitted only when an operator authors a `[<profile>]\nmodels = [...]` block. Production has none.

### 2.2 Production cascade.toml shape

Inspected `config/cascade.toml` at HEAD `49566db3d` (2026-05-11): top-level namespaces are exclusively `providers.`, `models.`, `routes.`, `tier.`, `tier-group.`, `profiles.`. Zero per-profile `[X]\nmodels = [...]` blocks. The flat materializer arm contributes nothing to the production runtime path.

### 2.3 Live declarative reader

`lib/cascade/cascade_catalog_runtime.ml` already loads `cascade.toml` through `Cascade_declarative_hotpath.try_load_declarative`, validates it, and exposes:
- `known_profile_names : ?sw/net/clock:_ -> unit -> (string list, string) result`
- `resolve_declared_name : ?sw/net/clock:_ -> raw_name:string -> unit -> (string, string) result`
- `models_of_cascade_name : ?sw/net/clock:_ -> string -> (string list, string) result`
- `inspect_active` returns the full snapshot with profile metadata (`keeper_assignable`, `fallback_cascade`, `required_capability_profile`, etc.).

The snapshot already carries every field `catalog_entry` exposes; readers can be ported one-to-one.

### 2.4 Test fixture inventory

After the Pattern A sweep (PR #14616), ~30 test fixtures across 6 suites write per-profile `[X]\nmodels = [...]` TOML and rely on the materializer's flat key arm + legacy reader. They pass today because the materializer still emits the flat keys; under this RFC's Phase 4 they would all fail.

Affected suites at RFC drafting time were the catalog runtime suite plus several
TOML materialization and dashboard cascade fixtures. The purge branch deletes
the standalone legacy flat-TOML suites instead of rewriting them.

## 3. Design

### 3.1 Reader replacement map

| Legacy call | Replacement | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `load_catalog ~config_path` | `Cascade_catalog_runtime.inspect_active ()` → extract `snapshot.profiles` | Snapshot carries the equivalent `catalog_entry` fields. Path arg dropped; resolver/runtime own the path. |
| `load_profile_weighted ~config_path ~name` | `Cascade_catalog_runtime.models_of_cascade_name name` plus `lookup_active_profile` for the full weighted entries | Returns `Result`; callers gain explicit error surfacing. |
| `load_profile ~config_path ~name` | `models_of_cascade_name` (drops weight metadata, same as legacy) | Direct substitute. |
| `is_deprecated_logical_profile_name` | Removed — no compatibility filter remains in catalog discovery. | Route/profile mistakes surface through normal validation instead of a silent filter. |

### 3.2 Materializer arm removal

The old per-profile TOML materializer arms are deleted; a per-profile `[X]`
block is now a parse error so operators discover the new schema requirement
explicitly rather than silently being ignored.

### 3.3 Snapshot reentrancy

`Cascade_catalog_runtime` already caches the active snapshot keyed by `source_path` mtime, and `inspect_active` is reentrancy-safe (mutex-guarded `_cache`). Hot-path callers (`Keeper_config.default_cascade_name`, `keeper_turn_cascade_budget`, etc.) can call it freely; each call resolves to a cheap `Hashtbl.find_opt` after the first mtime check.

For very hot paths that pre-RFC read the cached-string, introduce `default_cascade_name : unit -> string` returning the live answer (or the spec-driven `Cascade_routes.first_alias_or_key Keeper_turn` if the snapshot is unavailable). Callers add `()`. The blast radius is 18 sites, all internal.

### 3.4 Test fixture migration

Two strategies:

1. **Per-profile → declarative tier-group**: each `[X]\nmodels = ["provider:auto"]` block becomes
   ```toml
   [tier.X]
   members = ["X-binding"]   # references a binding name

   [tier-group.X]
   tiers = ["X"]

   [routes.keeper_turn]      # if X was the keeper default
   target = "tier-group.X"
   ```
   Plus the matching `[providers.<provider>]` + `[<provider>.<model>]` binding blocks.

2. **Obsolete fixture removal**: delete the flat JSON-shaped `test_cascade_catalog_runtime` suite instead of preserving its transformer. Declarative parser/validator/hotpath suites own the TOML-only contract.

Strategy (2) is cheap for the 23-fixture catalog_runtime suite. Strategy (1) is required for the per-fixture-tailored tests where fixture content is itself the subject of assertion.

## 4. Phases

### Phase 1 — `Keeper_cascade_profile` reader migration (Task #29, target PR)

Replace the 3 sites in `lib/keeper/keeper_cascade_profile.ml` (`catalog_entries`, `catalog_names`, `catalog_names_result`) with `Cascade_catalog_runtime` queries. Add `Keeper_config.default_cascade_name : unit -> string` returning the live snapshot's first profile (with the existing static fallback for boot ordering). Update 18 callers to `()`.

Acceptance:
- All existing tests pass (Pattern A fixtures still emit flat JSON which the materializer keeps emitting — Phase 1 doesn't touch the materializer arm).
- `Cascade_catalog_runtime.resolve_declared_name ~raw_name:""` returns the same name as `Keeper_config.default_cascade_name ()` in test fixtures that install a catalog.
- Production behavior of `keeper_turn_cascade_budget`/`keeper_turn_up_create`/etc. now references the *live* default cascade name (`"primary"` per current config), not the init-cached `"default"`.

### Phase 2 — Remaining lib callers migration (Task #30)

`lib/dashboard_cascade.ml`, `lib/cascade_catalog_validator.ml`, `lib/cascade/cascade_routes.ml`, `lib/cascade/cascade_catalog_runtime.ml` (internal callers — yes, the runtime itself calls the legacy loader in one spot), `lib/cascade/cascade_config.ml` (4 sites). Each ports to the snapshot reader.

Acceptance:
- `rg "Cascade_config_loader\.load_(catalog|profile_weighted|profile)\b" lib/` returns zero hits.
- All existing tests still pass (still Phase A test fixtures emit flat JSON).

### Phase 3 — Test fixture migration (Task #31)

Migrate fixtures suite-by-suite, or delete fixtures whose only assertion is
legacy flat-TOML compatibility.

Acceptance:
- All cascade-area suites pass on declarative-only fixtures.
- Materializer arm `<profile>_models` flat key emission is now unused at runtime; gating that with a CI-asserted "no flat key emission" test is acceptable scope creep.

### Phase 4 — Delete legacy API (Task #32)

Remove:
- `Cascade_config_loader.load_catalog` + `.mli` signature.
- `load_profile_weighted` + `.mli`.
- `load_profile` + `.mli`.
- The per-profile bridge that converted flat keys into `Cascade_ref.cascade_profile`.
- `weighted_entry` type if no other reader consumes it.
- `catalog_entry` type — replaced by the snapshot's profile representation.
- The per-profile field arms in `Cascade_toml_materializer`.

Final acceptance:
- `rg "load_catalog\|load_profile" lib/` returns zero hits.
- `rg "_models" lib/cascade/` returns zero hits in the *materializer* path; only the declarative `[models.X]` namespace remains.
- `dune build` clean; all cascade tests pass; CI green.

## 5. Risks

### 5.1 Snapshot bootstrap ordering

`Keeper_config` module-init currently reads `Keeper_cascade_profile.cascade_name_for_use Keeper_turn` at load time. If we replace it with a function that consults `Cascade_catalog_runtime`, callers during very early boot (before catalog install) get the static fallback path. This matches today's behavior (init-cached `"default"` = static spec fallback), so no regression — but it does mean the *first* runtime caller after catalog install sees the new value, not the cached one. Document explicitly: callers that need bootstrap-stable values should pin them at the call site.

### 5.2 Per-profile-only operator configs

Audit each known operator setup (kidsnote, internal envs). If any operator has a per-profile `cascade.toml` they wrote by hand, Phase 4 breaks them. Mitigation: Phase 4 ships with a migration script (`scripts/cascade/migrate_flat_to_declarative.sh`) that converts per-profile blocks to the equivalent tier-group/binding triple, and a one-release deprecation window where the materializer arm logs a `WARN` on use.

### 5.3 Test suite migration churn

~30 fixtures across 6 suites. Phase 3 risks getting bogged down. Mitigation: do the mechanical `flat_json_to_toml` retrofit first (covers 23 fixtures), then attack remaining suites in priority order, each as its own PR.

### 5.4 Hidden flat-key consumers outside `lib/`

`rg` only scans the current source tree. Forks, downstream plugins, and operator scripts that read `cascade.json` directly would break. Mitigation: Phase 4 PR body includes a "downstream check" callout asking maintainers to grep their forks.

## 6. Acceptance criteria

Cumulative across phases:

1. `Keeper_config.default_cascade_name ()` returns the live snapshot's first profile (not the init-cached spec fallback) when a catalog is installed. Closes #14624.
2. `Cascade_config_loader.load_catalog` / `load_profile_weighted` / `load_profile` and the old per-profile bridge deleted. No lib reader of `<profile>_models` flat JSON keys remains.
3. `Cascade_toml_materializer` no longer emits `<profile>_models` keys. Per-profile `[X]\nmodels = [...]` TOML blocks parse-error explicitly.
4. All cascade-area test suites (8 suites, ~166 tests) green on declarative-only fixtures.
5. CI green; `dune build` clean; no new ocamlformat violations in changed files (existing pre-existing violations not reformatted per project policy).
