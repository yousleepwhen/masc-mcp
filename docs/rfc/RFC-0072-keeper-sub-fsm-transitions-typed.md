# RFC-0072 — Type-encoded keeper sub-FSM transitions (cascade + turn_phase)

## 1. Background

Keeper composite lifecycle (`RFC-0003`) is partitioned into 4 sub-FSM axes that the keeper registry maintains as one `current_turn_observation` record:

| Axis | Type | Variants | Validator | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Decision stage | `decision_stage` | 4 | `validate_decision_transition` | **Compile-time enforced** (PR #14887 + #14893) |
| Cascade state | `cascade_state` | 5 | `validate_cascade_transition` | Runtime `invalid_arg` |
| Turn phase | `turn_phase` | 8+ | `validate_turn_phase_transition` | Runtime `invalid_arg` |
| Compaction stage | `compaction_stage` | (TBD) | `validate_compaction_transition` | Runtime (separate audit) |

PR #14887 (`set_turn_decision_stage`) + PR #14893 (`validate_decision_transition`) closed the decision axis by **input type refinement**: a `decision_stage_active` type that excludes `Decision_undecided` makes the 3 forbidden `<active>_to_undecided` transitions unrepresentable.

This RFC proposes extending the type-encoded enforcement to the **cascade** and **turn_phase** axes.

## 2. Problem

The decision axis was uniquely closable by single-target refinement because its 3 forbidden pairs all target the same state (`Decision_undecided`). The cascade and turn_phase axes do not have this property.

### 2.1 Cascade — 7 forbidden pairs scattered by source

`cascade_state` = { Idle, Selecting, Trying, Done, Exhausted } (5 variants). The 25-pair matrix admits 18 transitions and forbids 7:

| Source | Forbidden targets |
|---|---|
| Idle | Trying, Done, Exhausted |
| Selecting | Done, Exhausted |
| Done | Exhausted |
| Exhausted | Done |

Per-target valid sources:

| Target | Valid sources | Forbidden sources |
|---|---|---|
| Idle | any | (none) |
| Selecting | any | (none) |
| Trying | Selecting, Trying, Done, Exhausted | **Idle** |
| Done | Trying, Done | **Idle, Selecting, Exhausted** |
| Exhausted | Trying, Exhausted | **Idle, Selecting, Done** |

A single-axis type exclusion (decision pattern) cannot encode this — `Trying`, `Done`, `Exhausted` each have different source restrictions.

### 2.2 Turn phase — even more scattered

`turn_phase` = { Idle, Prompting, Routing, Executing, Compacting, Finalizing, Exhausted, ... } (8+ variants). The matrix has 60+ pairs with forbidden cycles like `Idle -> Compacting` (Idle has no measurement to compact). The forbidden set is larger and the topology is acyclic-with-retries, not a simple sub-sum.

### 2.3 Current enforcement is runtime-only

Both validators raise `Invalid_argument` at the moment a forbidden pair is dispatched through `set_turn_cascade_state` / `set_turn_phase`. The keeper lifecycle has a known incident class — `keeper_registry.ml:721 (2026-05-08)` raised `Assert_failure` from a sparse FSM match. The cascade / turn_phase validators are the next frontier of the same risk.

### 2.4 Caller fan-out

| Function | Production callers | Test callers | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| `set_turn_cascade_state` | 4 (`keeper_unified_turn.ml` ×2, `keeper_run_tools.ml` ×2) | 12+ | ~16 |
| `set_turn_phase` | TBD (audit) | TBD | TBD |
| `validate_cascade_transition` | 0 (test-only) | 5+ | 5+ |
| `validate_turn_phase_transition` | 0 (test-only) | 4+ | 4+ |

A naive single-PR refactor of `set_turn_cascade_state`'s caller chain hits the **A1 abort signal** (>150 LOC impl) of `~/me/.claude/plans/fuzzy-twirling-chipmunk.md`. The work must be phased.

## 3. Goal

For both cascade and turn_phase sub-FSMs:

1. Replace runtime `invalid_arg` from forbidden transition pairs with **compile-time impossibility**.
2. Make the *valid transition set* a first-class value (GADT with one constructor per admitted pair), so adding a new variant or transition is a deliberate type-level commit.
3. Preserve caller ergonomics where possible — callers should not be forced to thread from-state explicitly through call chains unless they already know it.
4. Land the change in **3+ small PRs**, none exceeding 150 LOC impl, with each PR independently testable.

Out of scope for this RFC: compaction axis (separate audit needed — variants and topology not yet inventoried in this document).

## 4. Design

### 4.1 GADT pattern (precedent: existing `Decision_transition` module)

`lib/keeper/keeper_registry.ml` already defines `Decision_transition` GADT enumerating the 9 valid cross-state decision transitions (currently unused in production). The cascade axis mirrors this with **18 valid transitions**:

```ocaml
module Cascade_transition = struct
  type ('from, 'to_) t =
    (* idempotents (5) *)
    | Idle_to_idle : (cascade_idle, cascade_idle) t
    | Selecting_to_selecting : (cascade_selecting, cascade_selecting) t
    | Trying_to_trying : (cascade_trying, cascade_trying) t
    | Done_to_done : (cascade_done, cascade_done) t
    | Exhausted_to_exhausted : (cascade_exhausted, cascade_exhausted) t

    (* boot path (1) *)
    | Idle_to_selecting : (cascade_idle, cascade_selecting) t

    (* dispatch (1) *)
    | Selecting_to_trying : (cascade_selecting, cascade_trying) t

    (* retry / re-entry (3) *)
    | Selecting_to_idle : (cascade_selecting, cascade_idle) t
    | Trying_to_idle : (cascade_trying, cascade_idle) t
    | Trying_to_selecting : (cascade_trying, cascade_selecting) t

    (* completion / exhaustion (2) *)
    | Trying_to_done : (cascade_trying, cascade_done) t
    | Trying_to_exhausted : (cascade_trying, cascade_exhausted) t

    (* compaction-driven retry (6) *)
    | Done_to_idle : (cascade_done, cascade_idle) t
    | Done_to_selecting : (cascade_done, cascade_selecting) t
    | Done_to_trying : (cascade_done, cascade_trying) t
    | Exhausted_to_idle : (cascade_exhausted, cascade_idle) t
    | Exhausted_to_selecting : (cascade_exhausted, cascade_selecting) t
    | Exhausted_to_trying : (cascade_exhausted, cascade_trying) t
end
```

A similar `Turn_phase_transition` module enumerates valid turn-phase pairs.

### 4.2 Caller adapter — preserve `set_turn_cascade_state` ergonomics

Forcing every caller to construct a `Cascade_transition.t` value would break the "target-only" pattern that 16 call sites currently rely on. Instead:

```ocaml
(* set_turn_cascade_state stays target-only at the API surface *)
val set_turn_cascade_state :
  base_path:string -> string -> packed_cascade_state -> unit

(* Internal: read current state, construct the transition GADT.
   If the (from, target) pair is not representable in Cascade_transition.t,
   the internal helper is *type-unreachable* — meaning, by spec invariant,
   it cannot happen.  When it does (spec violation by a future caller), we
   surface a typed [transition_spec_violation] error instead of invalid_arg. *)
val resolve_cascade_transition :
  from:packed_cascade_state -> target:packed_cascade_state ->
  (packed_cascade_transition, cascade_transition_spec_violation) result
```

Where `cascade_transition_spec_violation` is a typed sum capturing each forbidden pair as a named constructor, eliminating string-based diagnostic messages.

### 4.3 Validator becomes a resolver shim raising a typed exception

The original plan (mirroring PR #14893's `validate_decision_transition`) was to make `validate_cascade_transition` a compile-time fixture: an explicit `()`-returning match where forbidden pairs are unrepresentable. That works for the decision axis because the `to_` argument can be refined to `decision_stage_active` (a non-GADT enum that *excludes* the forbidden targets). It does **not** generalise to the cascade/turn_phase axes: the inputs are `packed_*` existentials (`Packed : 'a witness -> packed_*`), so a match over `(packed, packed)` pairs cannot have its forbidden arms removed without making the function partial — and the GADT-through-`Packed` exhaustivity check produces a Warning-8 false positive (the #14893 → #14909 regression).

So the realised design (Phase 2-4b) is: `validate_*` and `set_turn_*` dispatch on `resolve_*_transition`'s typed `*_resolve_outcome` sum (3 constructors: transition / idempotent / violation), and on the violation arm they `raise` a **typed exception** carrying the `*_transition_spec_violation` payload — not `invalid_arg`-with-a-formatted-string (Phase 5). A `Printexc.register_printer` reproduces the prior message text for log output. This keeps the transition matrix a single source of truth in the resolver while making the violation channel typed and catchable.

### 4.3b Why a typed exception, not `Result.t`

`set_turn_*` and `validate_*` are fail-closed: a forbidden transition is a programmer error / spec violation, not a recoverable condition. Threading `Result.t` through their ~13 call sites would add no behaviour (every caller would `Result.get_ok` or re-raise) — the cost without the benefit. A typed exception keeps the call-site ergonomics of the prior `invalid_arg` while replacing the stringly-typed payload with the `*_transition_spec_violation` variant, so a caller that *does* want to discriminate can pattern-match it (today none does).

### 4.4 Compaction axis (out of scope)

Compaction has a separate transition matrix (`compaction_accumulating`, `compaction_compacting`, etc.). A separate inventory PR audits its valid pairs and forbidden set before extending this RFC.

## 5. Migration plan

### Phase 1 — Cascade_transition GADT introduction (no behavior change)

- Define `Cascade_transition.t` GADT in `keeper_registry.ml`
- Implement `resolve_cascade_transition` (returns `Result.t` typed error)
- Existing `validate_cascade_transition` left unchanged
- Tests: GADT exhaustivity check (compile-time)
- LOC: ~80
- Risk: low (additive)

### Phase 2 — `set_turn_cascade_state` internal dispatch via GADT

- Internal implementation reads `obs.cascade_state`, calls `resolve_cascade_transition`, dispatches via GADT match
- On `Error spec_violation`: emit typed error (no `invalid_arg`)
- External API signature unchanged
- LOC: ~50
- Risk: medium (internal logic change in hot path; covered by existing tests)

### Phase 3 — `validate_cascade_transition` compile-time fixture

- Refactor function body to 18-pair `()` match (same shape as #14893 for decision)
- Update tests: delete `test_invalid_cascade_transitions` and `test_cascade_message_includes_labels`
- LOC: ~70
- Risk: low (test surface change consistent with #14893 precedent)

### Phase 4 — Turn_phase_transition GADT (parallel to Phase 1-3 for turn_phase axis)

Same 3-phase structure applied to `turn_phase`. Separate sub-PRs because the variant count is larger and the matrix shape differs.

- Phase 4a (PR #14912): realign the dead-code `Turn_phase_transition` GADT to the cascade shape (drop idempotent self-loops, 30→23 cross-state constructors), add `turn_phase_transition_spec_violation` (19 forbidden), add `resolve_turn_phase_transition`. Additive.
- Phase 4b (PR #14918): route `validate_turn_phase_transition` + `set_turn_phase` through the resolver; collapse the 49-arm matrix to a 3-arm `turn_phase_resolve_outcome` match; fix the idempotent-self-loop spurious-broadcast bug (mirrors cascade Phase 2).

### Phase 5 — Typed transition exceptions (closeout of R-1, R-2)

The 4 `invalid_arg` sites left by Phases 1-4b (`validate_cascade_transition`, `set_turn_cascade_state`, `validate_turn_phase_transition`, `set_turn_phase`) raise `Invalid_argument` with the `*_transition_spec_violation` tag projected into a string. Phase 5 replaces them with two typed exceptions:

```ocaml
exception Cascade_transition_violation of
  { where : string
  ; from : packed_cascade_state
  ; to_ : packed_cascade_state
  ; violation : cascade_transition_spec_violation
  }

exception Turn_phase_transition_violation of
  { where : string
  ; from : packed_turn_phase
  ; to_ : packed_turn_phase
  ; violation : turn_phase_transition_spec_violation
  }
```

- `Printexc.register_printer` for both, reproducing the prior `<where>: invalid <axis> transition <from> -> <to> (spec_violation=<tag>)` message — log output and generic `exn`-catchers see no change.
- `Keeper_fsm_guard_runtime.wrap_unit`'s catch is widened from `(Assert_failure _ | Invalid_argument _)` to all exceptions, so the `metric_fsm_guard_violation` counter still fires on the new typed exceptions (it cannot *name* them — `Keeper_registry` already depends on that module, so a back-reference would form a cycle).
- Tests (`test_keeper_sub_fsm_guards.ml`): `capture_invalid_arg` + substring-needle assertions replaced by pattern-matching the typed `violation` payload + a single `Printexc.to_string` render check per axis. (Bonus: this rewrite also fixes a latent broken test — `test_turn_phase_message_includes_labels` asserted `Turn_routing -> Turn_exhausted` is rejected, but PR #14395 made that pair *valid*; the heavy `dune test` CI step skips on most PRs so it went unnoticed.)
- LOC: ~+130 / -55. Risk: low (typed payload + printer; no behaviour change on the success path; failure path message text preserved).

### Phase 6 — Compaction axis: typed exception, no GADT/resolver

Inventory: `compaction_stage` has **3 states** (`accumulating`, `compacting`, `done`) → a 3×3 matrix = 3 idempotent + 3 valid cross-state + 3 forbidden. The pre-Phase-6 `validate_compaction_transition` was a bare `assert (match (from, to) with … -> true | … -> false)` inside `wrap_unit` — exhaustive (Warning-8 tripwire intact) but its `Assert_failure` carried only a file/line, not the rejected pair.

Decision: apply the **typed-exception + diagnostic-label** half of the pattern (mirroring what #14389 gave the other axes' messages, going straight to typed since this axis never had an `invalid_arg` string phase), but **not** the GADT/resolver half — with 3 states and a single consumer (`validate_compaction_transition` ← `compaction_stage_after_event`), a `Compaction_transition` GADT (3 cross-state constructors) and a `resolve_compaction_transition` indirection would be premature abstraction.

What ships:
- `compaction_transition_spec_violation` (3 constructors: `Accumulating_to_done` / `Done_to_accumulating` / `Done_to_compacting`) + `_to_tag`.
- `exception Compaction_transition_violation of { where; from; to_; violation }` + `Printexc.register_printer` + `raise_*` helper + `packed_compaction_stage_label` (constructor-name label, mirrors `packed_cascade_state_label`).
- `validate_compaction_transition` body: `assert (match … -> bool)` → `match … with <6 valid> -> () | <3 forbidden> -> raise_compaction_transition_violation …`, still inside `wrap_unit` (`metric_fsm_guard_violation` action=`compaction_transition`, stage=`guard` still fires). Match stays exhaustive.
- Tests: `test_invalid_compaction_transitions` catches `Compaction_transition_violation _` (was `Assert_failure _`) + checks payload endpoints; new `test_compaction_violation_payload` (typed `violation` tag + `Printexc.to_string` render).
- LOC: ~+95 / -25. Risk: low (success path unchanged; failure path gains labels).

## 6. Risks

### 6.1 GADT introduces complexity

GADTs are an advanced OCaml feature. Future maintainers without GADT familiarity may misunderstand the pattern. Mitigation: each GADT module has docstring linking back to this RFC + to `Decision_transition` (precedent module). The 18-pair enumeration is more transparent than the witness-type pattern alone.

### 6.2 `resolve_cascade_transition`'s `Error` case at runtime

Even with GADT, runtime can still hit spec violations if a future code change creates a forbidden pair (the type system doesn't prevent it — only documents the contract). Difference from `invalid_arg`: the error path is *typed* and *catchable* by the caller. Production behavior unchanged (still aborts), but the typed error gives observability.

### 6.3 Test deletion concerns

Phase 3 deletes runtime-raise tests because the contract moves to the type system. Same pattern as PR #14893 — well-documented precedent. Reviewers should not require test preservation when the test cannot compile against the new signature.

### 6.4 Caller fan-out underestimation

The audit in §2.4 counted explicit `set_turn_cascade_state` calls. There may be indirect callers via helpers (e.g., `prepare_turn_retry_after_compaction`) not yet enumerated. Phase 1 begins with a complete `rg` sweep before any signature change.

## 7. Acceptance criteria

- **R-1**: `cascade_state` axis has 0 `invalid_arg` sites in `lib/` — **met by Phase 5** (the 2 cascade sites raise `Cascade_transition_violation` instead).
- **R-2**: `turn_phase` axis has 0 `invalid_arg` sites in `lib/` — **met by Phase 5** (the 2 turn_phase sites raise `Turn_phase_transition_violation` instead).
- **R-3**: All `cascade_state` valid transitions are first-class GADT constructors — met by Phase 1.
- **R-4**: Adding a new `cascade_state` (or `turn_phase`) variant requires editing the resolver and triggers Warning 8 at all match sites — met by Phase 1 / Phase 4a.
- **R-5**: Existing test coverage is preserved or replaced by compile-time / typed-payload enforcement (no behavior regression) — met by Phase 3 / 4b / 5 / 6.
- **R-6**: Phase 1, 2, 3, 4 (a/b), 5, and 6 each ship in independent PRs, each <150 LOC impl.
- **R-7**: `compaction_stage` forbidden transitions raise a typed exception (not `Assert_failure`), carrying the rejected pair + violation tag — met by Phase 6. (No GADT for this axis: deliberate, see §5 Phase 6.)
- **R-8**: All 4 keeper sub-FSM axes (decision / cascade / turn_phase / compaction) are closed — decision via input refinement (#14887/#14893), cascade + turn_phase via resolver + typed exception (#14903→#14935), compaction via typed exception (Phase 6). No `_ -> false` catch-all and no untyped runtime rejection (`invalid_arg` / bare `Assert_failure`) remains on any axis's validator.

## 8. Open questions

1. **OQ-1**: Should `Compaction_transition` GADT be added in this RFC or deferred? — Recommendation: defer to amendment after Phase 1-4 lands.
2. **OQ-2** (resolved by Phase 5): `resolve_*_transition` returns the `*_resolve_outcome` sum; the violation arm carries the `*_transition_spec_violation` variant, and that variant is re-raised on the typed `*_transition_violation` exception. Carrying the TLA+ action name was not needed — the `*_transition_spec_violation` constructor name *is* a stable identifier for the violated pair, and the `Printexc` printer renders it. Escalate only if TLA+ trace integration later wants the action name verbatim.
3. **OQ-3**: Should the existing `Decision_transition` GADT also be activated (PR-7 of this RFC) for symmetry, or left as standalone documentation? — Recommendation: defer; #14887 already closed the decision axis via input refinement, and GADT activation would force from-state threading without semantic gain.
