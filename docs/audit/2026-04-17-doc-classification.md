# MASC docs/ classification — 2026-04-17

> Read-only audit of all 145 markdown files under `docs/`.
> Methodology: three Explore subagents in parallel, each scanning ~48 files.
> For every file the agent (a) read the head of the body, (b) ran
> `rg -F "<basename>" lib/ bin/ scripts/ README.md ROADMAP.md`, and
> (c) classified into A/B/C/D (definitions below).
> Disposition is advisory; actual delete / merge / frontmatter PRs are
> tracked separately.

## Categories

- **A · Live** — referenced by code or canonical surface. Action: **keep + frontmatter**.
- **B · Historical** — coherent design or runbook, no current code reference. Action default: **delete** (per user policy: aggressive removal, no archive stubs). Exception: `archive` if the body anchors an in-flight migration.
- **C · Hype / Speculative** — vision or aspirational content not anchored in code. Action: **delete**.
- **D · Duplicate** — same / near-same subject as another doc. Action: **delete loser** or `merge_into:<winner>`.

## Aggregate counts

| Category | Count | Suggested action |
|---|---|---|
| A · Live | 81 | keep + frontmatter |
| B · Historical (delete) | 32 | delete (no stub) |
| B · Historical (archive: in-flight) | 14 | move to `docs/archive/2026-04/` |
| C · Hype | 7 | delete |
| D · Duplicate / merge | 11 | delete loser or merge into winner |
| **Total** | **145** | |

## Frontmatter standard (for A category)

When the FRONTMATTER PR runs, every A-category file gets:

```yaml
---
status: live | reference | runbook
last_verified: 2026-04-17
code_refs:
  - lib/<file>.ml
  - lib/<file>.mli
---
```

`code_refs` must be non-empty (≥ 1 valid path). If a file lacks any
real code ref, it does not belong in A — re-classify before applying
frontmatter.

## High-risk-flag deletions

These four were marked C and `delete` but flagged `risk: high` — please
double-check before the DELETE PR runs:

- `GAME-VIEW-PROTOCOL.md`
- `HOLONIC-ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `INTERRUPT-DESIGN.md`
- `MASC-V2-DESIGN.md`

The risk is reputational, not operational: these are the most aspirational
files in the repo, so deleting them is exactly the goal. The `high` flag
just means: confirm one more time that the body really is vision-only.

## Duplicate / merge pairs

| Loser | Winner | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `GLOSSARY.md` | `spec/00-glossary.md` | header explicitly marks loser as superseded |
| `MERGED-ARCHITECTURE-SSOT.md` | `spec/SPEC-INDEX.md` + `spec/01-system-overview.md` | header marks both spec files as canonical |
| `QUICKSTART.md` | `QUICK-START.md` | loser is a 3-line redirect; pure noise |
| `cascade/README.md` | `docs/spec/` (system-wide) | personal note, redundant |
| `cascade/STRATEGY-GUIDE.md` | `docs/observability/cascade-metrics.md` | personal note, not team contract |

## Next steps (separate PRs, not in this audit)

1. **DELETE PR** — B (delete subset) + C + D losers in one `git rm` sweep. PR body summarizes counts and lists high-risk-flag files explicitly.
2. **ARCHIVE PR** — B (archive subset, 14 files) moved to `docs/archive/2026-04/`. No redirect stubs.
3. **MERGE PR** — D pairs (5 files) merged into winners. Run a follow-up `rg` for inbound links to losers and patch them in the same PR.
4. **FRONTMATTER PR** — All A files get the YAML frontmatter described above. CI gate to enforce it on new docs is optional follow-up.

Each of these is small and reversible (git history is the SSOT). Do
them in order; do not bundle them into one PR.
