## Progress (PR #14941)

- **tool_board.ml**: 2162 → 1706 lines (-456)
- **tool_shard.ml**: 2152 → 2094 lines (-58)
- **lib/ide/**: extracted as `masc_mcp.ide` sub-library
- **Total lines removed from god files**: ~530
- **Build status**: dune build lib/masc_mcp.cma passes

## Phase Plan

### Phase 1: Root-level god files (highest impact)
- [x] lib/tool_board.ml → tool_board_schemas extracted (469 lines, 2162→1706)
- [x] lib/tool_shard.ml → tool_shard_schemas extracted (61 lines, 2152→2094)
- [ ] lib/prometheus.ml → lib/prometheus/ sub-lib
- [ ] lib/tool_board.ml → lib/tool_board/ sub-lib
- [ ] lib/tool_shard.ml → lib/tool_shard/ sub-lib
- [x] lib/provider_adapter.ml → removed after this audit

### Phase 2: Directory extraction (directories without dune files)
- [x] lib/ide/ (7 files) → masc_mcp.ide sub-lib (zero flat-namespace deps)
- [ ] lib/keeper/ (500 files) → masc_mcp.keeper sub-lib
- [ ] lib/server/ (142 files) → masc_mcp.server sub-lib
- [ ] lib/dashboard/ (104 files) → masc_mcp.dashboard sub-lib
- [ ] lib/cascade/ (83 files) → masc_mcp.cascade sub-lib

### Phase 3: Remaining directories
- [ ] lib/operator/ (18 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/goal/ (10 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/grpc/ (10 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/local/ (10 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/otel/ (10 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/voice/ (8 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/ide/ (7 files) → sub-lib
- [ ] lib/memory/ (2 files) → sub-lib or merge
