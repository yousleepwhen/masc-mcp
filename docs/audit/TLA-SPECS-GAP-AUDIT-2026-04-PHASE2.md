## 1. Why Phase 2 sweeps Phase 1's candidate list

Phase 1 §3.2 surfaced **21 specs** where `INDEX.md` shows the clean and buggy invariant sets are textually identical. The framing was:

> This may still be valid: the buggy cfg can override the Spec/Init/Next action (e.g. via a separate SpecBuggy definition that includes BugAction) while keeping the same invariants — that *is* the AGENT-LLM-A.md pattern. […] The point is structural: INDEX.md reveals 21 candidate-tautology rows that warrant per-spec inspection, not that all 21 are wrong.

A spot-check on `auth/AuthIdentityFSM` confirmed `Spec` vs `SpecBuggy` distinction. Phase 2 runs the same check across all 21.

## 2. Method

```bash
# /tmp/cycle11-tautology-sweep.sh — for each candidate:
clean_spec=$(grep -E "^SPECIFICATION" "$clean_cfg" | awk '{print $2}')
buggy_spec=$(grep -E "^SPECIFICATION" "$buggy_cfg" | awk '{print $2}')
[[ "$clean_spec" == "$buggy_spec" ]] && verdict="TAUTOLOGY" || verdict="VALID"
```

Necessary condition: different `SPECIFICATION` name. Sufficient confirmation: spot-check that `SpecBuggy` definition introduces a different `Next` relation (i.e. extends with `BugAction` or names a `NextBuggy` / `NextUnsafe`).

## 3. Sweep results

| Candidate | Clean SPEC | Buggy SPEC | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|
| admission-queue/AdmissionQueue | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| auth/AuthIdentityFSM | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/CascadeKeeperRecovery | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/CascadeStrategyStateful | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/KeeperContractViolated | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/KeeperEmptyToolUniverse | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/KeeperRecoveryOrchestration | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/KeeperStaleKilled | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/KeeperTurnScheduler | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| boundary/KeeperTurnTerminal | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/AuthIdentityFSM | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/DashboardCacheStampede | SpecClean | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/DiscoveryCacheTTL | SpecClean | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/DispatchCoverage | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/FileLockStarvation | SpecClean | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/HebbianLearning | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/KeepalivePhaseConsistency | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/KeeperPhaseRace | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/MemoryCompaction | Spec | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/SSEBroadcastBlock | SpecClean | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |
| bug-models/SessionRegistryGhost | SpecClean | SpecBuggy | **VALID** |

**21/21 VALID. Zero true tautologies.**

## 4. Spot-check confirmation (sample of 4)

The "different SPECIFICATION name" criterion is necessary but not sufficient — the buggy `Spec` must actually exercise a different `Next` relation. Verified on a representative sample:

```bash
$ rg "^SpecBuggy|^NextBuggy|^NextUnsafe" specs/...
```

| Spec | Buggy `Spec` definition | BugAction synthesis |
|---|---|---|
| `auth/AuthIdentityFSM.tla` | `SpecBuggy == Init /\ [][NextBuggy]_vars` | (separate `NextBuggy` action) |
| `boundary/KeeperContractViolated.tla` | `SpecBuggy == Init /\ [][NextBuggy]_vars` | (separate `NextBuggy` action) |
| `bug-models/HebbianLearning.tla` | `SpecBuggy == Init /\ [][NextUnsafe]_vars` | renamed `NextUnsafe` |
| `admission-queue/AdmissionQueue.tla` | `SpecBuggy == Init /\ [][NextBuggy]_vars` | `NextBuggy == \/ Next \/ FdGuardSkip \/ ReleaseSkipped` (extends `Next`) |

All four use the AGENT-LLM-A.md `Next \/ BugAction` recipe with one cosmetic divergence: **three different names** for the bug-extended transition relation (`NextBuggy`, `NextUnsafe`, occasionally inline). This is style drift, not correctness — addressed in §6.

## 5. Phase 1 verdict revision

Phase 1's "Tautology candidate" row in §4 ranked Medium severity with count 21. Phase 2 reduces this to **Medium severity, count 0**. The audit's working-list of pending hygiene items shrinks accordingly:

| Class | Phase 1 count | Phase 2 count | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0% Bug Model coverage | 8 specs | 8 specs | unchanged — needs domain-specific BugAction per spec |
| Tautology | 21 candidates | **0** | resolved in this Phase |
| Split-pair `*Bug.tla` style | 3 specs | 3 specs | unchanged |
| `specs/states/` artifact | 1 dir | 1 dir | unchanged |
| **NEW: BugAction naming drift** | — | 3 styles | uncovered in §4 spot-check |

The total surface is now **1 high-severity item (8 specs) + 3 low-severity hygiene items**, down from a fuzzy "29-item" appearance in Phase 1.

## 6. New finding: BugAction naming drift

Three names in use for the bug-extended transition:

- `NextBuggy` (most boundary/, most bug-models/, admission-queue)
- `NextUnsafe` (HebbianLearning)
- inline `\/ Next \/ <BugAction>` directly in `SpecBuggy` (rarer)

`KeeperOASAdvanced.tla` (the canonical example referenced in AGENT-LLM-A.md) uses `CancelledNeverAbsorbed` invariant + `CancelledAbsorbed` BugAction directly inside `Next`. So even the "canonical" spec doesn't follow a single naming convention.

This is a hygiene finding worth tracking, not blocking. A follow-up could:
1. Pick `NextBuggy` as canonical (most-used)
2. Migrate `NextUnsafe` (1 case) and inline cases (~few) in a single sweep PR
3. Add a `gen-tla-index.sh` lint that warns on non-`NextBuggy` names

Defer until a separate Phase or skip if the cost outweighs the value.

## 7. Updated phase plan

| Phase | Scope | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Initial gap survey, taxonomy | PR #12123 (MERGED) |
| **2 (this PR)** | **21-candidate tautology sweep** | **this PR** |
| 3 | 8-spec zero-coverage Bug Model triage; per-spec RFC index | next |
| 4 | Coverage ratchet (descriptive metric) wired into CI | after Phase 3 baseline |

Phase 3 will not write the buggy cfgs (each needs domain expertise) — it will *enumerate* per-spec RFC stubs so the work can fan out across follow-up PRs.

## 8. Ratchet note

Adding `candidate_tautology_specs` as a descriptive ratchet metric (Phase 1 §6) is no longer useful — the count is 0 and stays 0 unless `INDEX.md` regenerates with new identical rows that turn out to be valid. The ratchet would produce noise rather than signal. **Withdrawn.**

The other proposed metric, `domains_without_bug_model`, remains worth tracking. Its current floor is 5; goal is monotonic decrease.

## 9. Closing observation: candidate vs verdict discipline

Phase 1 spent care framing the 21 specs as *candidates* and refused to call them violations. Phase 2 confirms the framing was correct: zero of 21 are actual violations. Had Phase 1 over-claimed ("21 weak Bug Models"), Phase 2 would now be a full retraction.

The discipline mirrors the OAS chain: Phase 1 there flagged Layer C as `NEEDS SWEEP` (count 200+ raw references); Phase 2 refined the verdict to PASS via C1–C4 taxonomy. **In both audits the second phase narrows or zeroes out an over-broad first-phase signal.** This is a property of survey-style audits — wide net first, structural classification second, fixes only after the classification stabilizes.

For future audits in this style, expect the second pass to delete more than it adds.
