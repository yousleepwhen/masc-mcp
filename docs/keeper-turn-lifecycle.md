## Autonomous cycle sequence

This is the heartbeat-scheduled path. The supervisor launches a keepalive fiber that loops until `fiber_stop` is set.

            else turn dispatched

                T-->>A: results
                A->>R: append receipt outcome=(done/failed/cancelled)
                R-->>U: Ok meta or Error
            end
        end
    end
```

## Keepalive autonomous cycle flow

The scheduling loop that sits above the lifecycle phase FSM. Presence, snapshot, event intake, world observation, admission, and dispatch run in order until the fiber is stopped.

```mermaid

    E --> F{smart heartbeat gate}
    F -- Skip_idle and no wake/signal --> B
    F -- Emit/Skip_busy/woken --> G[sync room presence / heartbeat_ok or heartbeat_failed]
    G --> H{consecutive heartbeat failures over threshold?}
    H -- yes --> X[set failure reason; raise Keeper_fiber_crash]
    H -- no --> I[expire approval queue; maybe write heartbeat snapshot]
    I --> J[collect board events and event queue stimuli]
    J --> K[world observation + scheduling decision]
    K --> L{should_run_turn?}

    Q --> R[refresh work-as-heartbeat; recurring dispatch; stage timing]
    M --> R
    R --> B
    X --> Y[Supervisor records crash, lifecycle Crashed, recovery sweep may restart]
```

## Direct keeper message turn

This path bypasses the heartbeat scheduling loop entirely. `masc_keeper_msg` family calls enter through `Keeper_turn.handle_keeper_msg`, run preflight, and then call `Keeper_agent_run.run_turn` directly. The same OAS/cascade/tool/context engine is used internally.

```mermaid

    A[keeper_msg args] --> B[preflight_keeper_msg]
    B --> C{name/message/direct_reply valid? keeper exists?}

    D --> E[resilience/API-key/local endpoint preflight]
    E --> F[build prompt callback]
    F --> G[dynamic context: recovery snapshot, long-term memory, skills, worktree changes, telemetry, turn instructions, required tools]
    G --> H[Keeper_agent_run.run_turn]
    H --> I[prepare_run_context: inference params, session dir, checkpoint, base prompt, pre-dispatch compaction]
    I --> J[build_turn_context: sanitize user, memory/temporal context, append user]
    J --> K[prepare_agent_setup: tool surface, hooks, reducer, memory hooks]
    K --> L[Keeper_turn_driver.run_named]
    L --> M[OAS Agent/Pipeline loop]
    M --> N[post-run contracts, state snapshot, checkpoint, memory write, receipt]
    N --> O[metrics snapshot + lifecycle/broadcast + keepalive wake + response JSON]
```

## Unified turn swimlane

The two admission paths converge on the same execution engine. The diagram below places supervisor, heartbeat, direct message, and the shared `run_turn` + receipt path in a single sequence so the boundary between scheduling and dispatch is explicit.

```

**Invariant**: Both paths set `oas_dispatch_mode = Single_provider_agent_run` on the keeper-managed cascade engine. The keeper hot path never delegates provider fallback to an OAS internal cascade. This is enforced at runtime by `Keeper_cascade_engine.guard_keeper_hot_path` and pinned in `test/test_keeper_cascade_engine_guard.ml`.

## Autonomous vs Direct comparison

| Dimension | Autonomous cycle | Direct keeper message turn |
|---|---|---|
| Trigger | Heartbeat tick / scheduling decision | `masc_keeper_msg` direct request |
| Scheduling | `run_heartbeat_loop` admits turn after world observation | Immediate preflight then dispatch |
| Entry point | `Keeper_unified_turn.run_keeper_cycle` | `Keeper_turn.handle_keeper_msg` |
| Phase gate | Yes — skipped if phase blocks turn | No — direct turn is phase-agnostic but still checks keeper existence |
| Cascade selection | Same `cascade.toml` based resolution | Same `cascade.toml` based resolution |
| OAS dispatch mode | `Single_provider_agent_run` (enforced) | `Single_provider_agent_run` (enforced) |
| Tool surface | Same `compute_tool_surface` + OAS hooks | Same `compute_tool_surface` + OAS hooks |
| Receipt | Same `Keeper_execution_receipt` append | Same `Keeper_execution_receipt` append |
| Lifecycle wake | Returns into keepalive loop | Wakes keepalive so next cycle picks up state change |

Both paths share `Keeper_agent_run.run_turn` as the common execution engine. The difference is strictly in admission: heartbeat-scheduled vs request-triggered.

## State machine

The typed FSM ADT in `lib/keeper/keeper_turn_fsm.mli` (Step 4a, #11184)
fixes the vocabulary; the diagram below mirrors the variants verbatim.
Step 4b will adopt these transitions at the implicit edges currently
spread across `keeper_unified_turn.ml` and `keeper_agent_run.ml`.

```mermaid

    Cascade_routing --> Failed: cascade build error (Failure_provider_error)

    Awaiting_tool_result --> Cancelled: fleet shutdown (Cancelled_fleet_shutdown)
    Done --> [*]

## Silent fail points (closed by Step 0a)

Pre Step 0a, four pre-dispatch paths emitted INFO logs without a `turn_id`
correlator, so a turn that died before dispatch left no row anyone could
look up by id. The four paths and the lines that now carry `keeper_turn_id`:

1. Phase gate skip — `keeper_unified_turn.ml:1062` (#11154)
2. Ollama saturated — `keeper_unified_turn.ml:1162` (#11154)
3. Cascade error — `keeper_unified_turn.ml:1242` (#11154)
4. Turn livelock blocked — `keeper_unified_turn.ml:1276` (#11154)

PR #11154 added `?keeper_turn_id` to `record_pre_dispatch_terminal_observation`
and threaded the value through all four call sites.  PR #11156 widened the
`Log.Make` functor surface so every `Log.<Module>.<level>` call accepts
`?keeper_name`/`?turn_id`; PR #11159 adopted the new arguments at the
silent-skip log lines so the structured log entry carries the same
correlator the receipt does.

## Tooling

- **`bin/masc-trace <base-path> <keeper> <turn_id>`** (#11168) — reads
  `<base-path>/.masc/keepers/<keeper>/execution-receipts/*.jsonl` and prints every
  row that matches the turn id.  First source the receipt path already
  populates; subsequent stacks widen to `tool_calls/` and `system_log_*`.

- **`Auth_resolve.emit_resolution_trace`** (#11161, #11162) — every
  bearer-token resolution attempt at the runtime-MCP boundary now emits
  a structured outcome before the cascade fires HTTP.  401-after-silent-
  fall-back is no longer the first signal an operator sees.

- **`Cascade_catalog_validator.codex_with_bound_actor_only_issue`** (#11164)
  — boot-time warn for cascades that include `cli-tool-a` without a
  bound-actor-tolerant fallback.  Surfaces the misconfiguration once
  instead of paying per-turn `no_tool_capable_provider` events.

- **`masc_keeper_turn_fsm_transitions_total`** (#11326) — Prometheus
  counter bumped inside `Keeper_turn_fsm.emit_transition`.  Labels
  `from`/`to`/`keeper` carry the typed ADT vocabulary (e.g.
  `to=failed:turn_livelock_blocked`) so PromQL can chart turn-state
  distribution per keeper without ETL on the log line.  Distinct from
  `masc_keeper_fsm_edge_transitions_total`, which encodes the cross
  sub-FSM edges (`ksm_to_kcl_routing`, etc.) used by
  `docs/keeper-fsm-graph.dot`.

## External comparison

MASC sits in a different product category from general-purpose agent SDKs. Keeping the positioning explicit prevents design decisions from drifting toward runner-centric or workspace-centric assumptions that do not fit an operator-governed control plane.

| Product family | Center of gravity | Turn model | Cascade ownership | Memory model | Operator surface |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agent-LLM-A Agent SDK | Runner / session | `Agent.run` loop with tool callbacks | OAS internal cascade | Session-scoped context + optional memory | Weak — run-level events only |
| Provider-D Agents SDK | Runner / session | `Runner.run` pipeline with handoffs | OAS internal cascade | Thread + vector store | Weak — run-level traces |
| Google ADK | Runner / agent graph | Event-loop with stateful agents | Model routing per agent | Session memory + artifacts | Medium — deployment + evaluation |
| OpenClaw | Workspace / orchestrator | Plan-execute with tool registry | Workspace-level fallback | Long-term memory bank + compression | Strong — workspace governance |
| Hermes | Workspace / skills | Skill-based execution graph | Provider fallback per skill | Context files + skill memory | Medium — provider + skill management |
| **MASC** | **Supervisor / cascade** | Heartbeat-scheduled autonomous cycle + direct `masc_keeper_msg` | **MASC-owned** `Keeper_cascade_engine` selects single-provider OAS runs | Three-layer: OAS checkpoint, MASC receipt/snapshot, memory hooks | **Strong** — registry phase, FSM, runtime manifest, receipt, lens, audit ring |

**Design implication**: When a feature request sounds like "add session memory" or "enable automatic provider fallback", the first question is which layer owns it. Session memory belongs to the OAS checkpoint layer. Automatic provider fallback belongs to the OAS cascade layer. MASC adds value by supervising, governing, and receipting those layers, not by reimplementing them.
