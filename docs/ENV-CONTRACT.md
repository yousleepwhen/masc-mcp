# Environment Variable Contract

This document defines the operator-facing contract for environment variables in
`masc-mcp`.

The core rule is simple:

- Environment variables are a process boot contract.
- Accessor-shaped code such as `let foo () = Sys.getenv_opt ...` does not imply
  shell-level hot reload.
- A running process only observes new env values when the process itself calls
  `Unix.putenv`, when an in-process boot override store is consulted, or when
  the value is modeled as a separate runtime control plane such as
  `Runtime_params`.

Use this document together with
[`BOOT-ENV-STATE-INVENTORY.md`](./BOOT-ENV-STATE-INVENTORY.md) and
[`TOML-RELOAD-MATRIX.md`](./TOML-RELOAD-MATRIX.md).

## Reload Classes

| Class | Meaning | Typical mechanism |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `boot_static` | Requires process restart | socket bind, config root resolution, startup seeding |
| `sweep_dynamic` | Applied on next supervisor sweep or periodic reconcile | running keeper declarative profile sync |
| `request_dynamic` | Applied on next request/turn/lookup | `cascade.toml` resolve path, some runtime getters |
| `immediate_dynamic` | Applied immediately inside the running process | `Runtime_params.set`, in-process override mutation |

## Default Policy

Every environment variable is treated as `boot_static` unless one of the
following is true:

1. The process mutates its own effective config inside the process, such as
   `Unix.putenv` or a boot override store.
2. The effective value is mediated through `Runtime_params`.
3. The consumer explicitly re-reads the source on the next request/turn and the
   surrounding subsystem is not already structurally fixed at boot.

The important operational distinction is:

- `runtime-readable` is an implementation detail.
- `reload_class` is the supported contract.

## Environment Variable Matrix

### 1. Boot-static environment inputs

These values decide process structure, roots, or startup-loaded policy and
should be treated as restart-required.

| Scope | Examples | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Runtime root and config roots | `MASC_BASE_PATH`, `MASC_CONFIG_DIR`, `MASC_PERSONAS_DIR`, `HOME` | `Config_dir_resolver` caches the resolved root for the life of the process |
| Server bind and socket topology | `MASC_HOST`, `MASC_HTTP_PORT`, `MASC_GRPC_PORT`, `MASC_WS_PORT`, `MASC_GRPC_ENABLED`, `MASC_WS_ENABLED`, `MASC_WEBRTC_ENABLED` | listeners and advertised base URLs are fixed during server startup |
| Backend/bootstrap wiring | `MASC_STORAGE_TYPE`, `MASC_STARTUP_WATCHDOG_SEC` | boot-time filesystem storage enforcement and watchdog setup |
| Startup-only TOML seeding | every `MASC_KEEPER_*` value sourced from `keeper_runtime.toml` | TOML is loaded once and injected into the process env during boot |
| Startup-loaded policy | tool policy related env plus `tool_policy.toml`-driven behavior | presets are loaded once at startup |

- [`config_dir_resolver.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/config_dir_resolver.ml)
- [`server_bootstrap_http.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/server/server_bootstrap_http.ml)
- [`keeper_runtime_config.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/keeper/keeper_runtime_config.ml)
- [`keeper_tool_policy.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/keeper/keeper_tool_policy.ml)

### 2. Env-backed defaults that become runtime-dynamic through `Runtime_params`

These env values still enter the system as boot inputs, but the effective
operator control plane is `Runtime_params`, not the parent shell env.

| Effective contract | Examples | Operator path |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `immediate_dynamic` | `keeper.keepalive_interval_sec`, `keeper.supervisor_sweep_sec`, `keeper.work_as_hb_enabled`, `keeper.smart_hb_enabled` | update via governance/dashboard APIs backed by `Runtime_params` |
| `request_dynamic` | keeper temperature/max_tokens and similar registered params | next `Runtime_params.get` call observes the override |

Representative code paths:

- [`runtime_params.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/runtime_params.ml)
- [`governance_registry.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/governance_registry.ml)
- [`keeper_config.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/keeper/keeper_config.ml)
- [`server_routes_http_routes_activity.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/server/server_routes_http_routes_activity.ml)

### 3. Accessor-shaped env readers with limited live effect

Some accessors are functions and therefore can re-read the process env.
Operationally, they should still be treated conservatively unless their
consumer is known to act on every request/turn.

| Pattern | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| Top-level `let foo = ...` | `boot_static` startup snapshot |
| `let foo () = ...` but consumer already allocated sockets/pools/fibers | still `boot_static` |
| `let foo () = ...` and consumer reads per request/turn | `request_dynamic` at most |

Examples:

- Transport feature flags in
  [`env_config_runtime.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/config/env_config_runtime.ml)
  are accessor-shaped, but listener lifecycles remain boot-static.
- `Config_dir_resolver` helpers read env accessors, but
  [`resolve()`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/config_dir_resolver.ml#L321)
  caches the result, so root changes are boot-static.

### 4. Execute exec gates (`request_dynamic`, additive-only)

Flags introduced by the P1–P6 exec rework. Each is opt-in: the
default keeps the pre-Execute JSON shape and execution path, and
turning a flag on only adds new fields or new code branches. No
field is ever removed by these flags, so downstream consumers
never break by enabling them.

Operator rollout procedure and observer log interpretation: see
[`EXECUTE-RUNBOOK.md`](./EXECUTE-RUNBOOK.md).

| Variable | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MASC_BASH_SEMANTIC_EXIT` | **on** (post flip PR) | Emits a `return_code_interpretation` object (typed `semantic_exit`) alongside the raw `status`. Set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off` to opt out and restore the pre-P1 byte-identical shape. See `lib/exec/exec_semantic.mli`. |
| `MASC_BASH_OUTPUT_CAP` | on (500 KB head + 500 KB tail each) | Head+tail truncation via `Exec_buffer`. `MASC_BASH_CAP_HEAD` / `MASC_BASH_CAP_TAIL` override the per-stream caps. See `lib/exec/exec_buffer.mli`. |
| `MASC_BASH_VERIFIABLE_MARKERS` | **on** (post flip PR) | Emits `verifiable_markers` from `Cdal_judge.of_exec_outcome` so the verifier cascade can consume typed `Test_pass {count}`, `Build_ok`, etc. without regex scraping. Set to `0` / `false` / `no` / `off` to opt out. See `lib/cdal_judge.mli`. |

Representative code paths:

- [`exec_semantic.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/exec/exec_semantic.ml)
- [`exec_buffer.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/exec/exec_buffer.ml)
- [`cdal_judge.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/cdal_judge.ml)
- [`worker_dev_tools.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/worker_dev_tools.ml) — Shell_command_gate caller integration

Because every flag here is `request_dynamic` on the Execute path
(read at tool-invocation time), operators can flip a flag without a
restart and the next `Execute` call picks it up.

### 5. Test-only boot overrides

The following flags exist only to make OCaml test executables deterministic:

| Variable | Default test behavior | Opt-in behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MASC_TEST_ALLOW_BASE_PATH_OVERRIDE` | ignore a shell-provided `MASC_BASE_PATH` override and re-sync to the requested path | preserve an explicit `MASC_BASE_PATH` override for resolver coverage |
| `MASC_TEST_ALLOW_CONFIG_PATH_OVERRIDE` | ignore inherited `MASC_CONFIG_DIR` / `MASC_PERSONAS_DIR` values captured from the parent shell | preserve explicit config/personas overrides for config-root coverage |

These are not operator-facing runtime controls and should not be used as
production launch knobs.

Representative code paths:

- [`coord_utils_backend_setup.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/coord/coord_utils_backend_setup.ml)
- [`config_dir_resolver.ml`](/Users/dancer/me/workspace/yousleepwhen/masc-mcp/lib/config_dir_resolver.ml)

## Rules for New Environment Variables

1. New env vars default to `boot_static`.
2. If operator live tuning is needed, add a `Runtime_params` entry instead of
   relying on shell env mutation.
3. Document the `reload_class` at the declaration site and in the relevant
   operator doc.
4. Do not use the phrase `runtime-readable` in operator-facing docs. Use one of
   the four reload classes instead.
