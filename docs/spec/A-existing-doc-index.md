# Appendix A: Existing Documentation Index

> 목적: tracked 문서를 `front door / maintained reference / historical / archive / cleanup action`으로 다시 분류한다.
> 기준일: 2026-03-25
> Baseline: `dune-project` version `2.148.0`

## Classification

| Status | 의미 |
|--------|------|
| Canonical | 현재 front-door 또는 운영 SSOT. 적극 유지 |
| Maintained Reference | 여전히 참조되거나 tool/test에 묶인 참고 문서 |
| Historical | superseded banner가 있는 과거 snapshot. 삭제 대신 맥락 보존 |
| Archive | `docs/archive/` 또는 실험/피드백 저장소 |
| Redirect Stub | 옛 경로 호환용 짧은 포인터 |
| Removed | 이번 정리에서 통합 후 삭제 |

## Notes

- This index is a cleanup ledger, not a promise that every reference document is current.
- A document stays in-tree when code, tests, fixtures, or tool help still cite it.
- When deleting or moving docs, re-run link checks and `test/test_tool_registration_consistency.exe` before treating the sweep as complete.
