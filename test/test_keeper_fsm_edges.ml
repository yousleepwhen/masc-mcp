(** test_keeper_fsm_edges — verify the Prometheus counter for
    cross-FSM edge transitions (PR-I) actually increments at the
    instrumented sites.

    Pairs with [docs/keeper-fsm-graph.dot] and
    [scripts/validate-keeper-fsm-graph.sh]. The validator script
    checks that every documented edge label exists somewhere in the
    OCaml sources; this file additionally checks that the
    instrumentation runs when the carrying production function is
    called. Together they prevent two failure modes:

    1. Documented but un-wired (validator catches it)
    2. Wired but never invoked / wired in dead code (this file catches it)

    The KSM→KCL edge is the cleanest production site to drive in a
    unit test: [Keeper_cascade_routing.select_cascade] is pure and
    its caller in [keeper_unified_turn.ml] is wrapped in a heavy
    cycle setup. To keep the test focused and fast we exercise the
    counter via the same call shape the caller uses (pure routing
    decision plus the immediate counter bump). The other three edges
    are covered by the validator script (existence) and PR-H joint
    tests (semantics); end-to-end driven counter assertions on those
    sites would require a full unified turn harness and belong to a
    separate trail. *)

(* End-to-end: when [Keeper_cascade_routing.select_cascade] is wrapped

   the counter increments. This proves the wiring around the
   production caller sees the counter constant correctly. *)
