(** RFC-0070 Phase 3c.0 — tests for [Keeper_sandbox_executor.Make].

    Demonstrates the Mock + functor composition end-to-end:
    [Keeper_sandbox_executor.Make(Keeper_docker_client_mock)] satisfies the same
    interface that [Keeper_sandbox_executor.Make(Keeper_docker_client_real)] will
    in Phase 3b-iv.2. *)
