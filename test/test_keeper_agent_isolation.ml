(** Tests for keeper-agent tool isolation.

    Validates the structural invariant that keeper tools and agent
    coordination tools occupy disjoint namespaces.

    Note: research-profile keepers intentionally receive masc_autoresearch_*
    and masc_research_* tools via the shard system. The isolation boundary
    is between keeper tools and agent coordination tools (spawned_agent_public).

    Pure synchronous tests — no Eio or network required. *)
