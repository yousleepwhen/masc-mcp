(** test_keeper_fsm_guard_actions — verify the runtime safety wrapper
    [Keeper_fsm_guard_runtime.wrap_unit] used by KeeperHeartbeat /
    KeeperTaskAcquisition spec-action guards.

    The PPX [@@fsm_guard] itself is exercised by the smoke test at
    [keeper_turn_fsm.ml:118] (Cycle 12 / Tier I3); this file pins the
    surrounding policy contract:

    1. The Prometheus counter constant matches the documented series.
    2. An honest thunk (no assert raised) leaves the counter alone.
    3. A buggy thunk (raises [Assert_failure], simulating a PPX-injected
       guard that observed a spec violation) bumps the counter by one
       and re-raises.
    4. [MASC_FSM_GUARD_ASSERT=0] no longer enables counter-only mode.
    5. Non-[Assert_failure] exceptions propagate unchanged — only the
       spec-violation channel is intercepted. *)
