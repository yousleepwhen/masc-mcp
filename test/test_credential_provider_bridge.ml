(** RFC-0019 PR-A — bridge resolver coverage for
    {!Keeper_repo_mapping.credentials_for_keeper}.

    This is the load-bearing helper consumed by
    {!Keeper_host_config_provider.resolve} when deciding whether to route a
    keeper through the {!Credential_store}.

    Pinned scenarios:

    1. No mapping for the keeper → [Ok []] from the helper.  The host
       config provider now interprets this as a fail-closed missing mapping
       error rather than a legacy resolver fallback.
    2. Mapping with exactly one repo → [Ok [credential]].
    3. Mapping with several repos that share one credential → [Ok
       [credential]] (deduplicated; the bridge expects a single
       single-element list to dispatch deterministically).
    4. Mapping with several repos with distinct credentials →
       [Ok [c1; c2]] in mapping order (the bridge surfaces ambiguity
       to the caller as a [Missing_bundle] with an actionable message;
       the helper itself stays total).
    5. Mapping references a non-existent credential → [Error _].
       Infrastructure failure, not absence; bridge should surface
       this rather than silently fall back.
    6. Wildcard ["*"] mapping → returns credentials for every
       registered repository (deduplicated by credential id).
    7. Direct keeper credential mapping → returns that credential even
       when repo-derived credentials are ambiguous or missing.

    Integration of [Keeper_host_config_provider.resolve] itself with
    [Coord.config] + filesystem bundles is exercised by
    [test_keeper_sandbox_docker_route]; this file stays pure to avoid
    re-staging that fixture. *)
