(** Contract test for {!Board_votes_json.load_persisted_posts} and
    {!Board_votes_json.load_persisted_comments}.

    Prior to this contract change, the loaders had signature
    [store -> unit] and swallowed any [exn] from the JSONL read into an
    in-function [Log.BoardLog.error].  Callers could not distinguish a
    successful "no file" load from a partially-loaded store after an IO
    failure.

    The current contract returns [(int, string * exn) result] and forces
    callers to acknowledge failure.  These tests pin the [Ok 0] branch
    that is exercised on every fresh server start (no persistence file
    yet). *)
