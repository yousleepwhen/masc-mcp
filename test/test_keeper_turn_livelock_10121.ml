(* test/test_keeper_turn_livelock_10121.ml

   #10121 reports 10 (keeper, turn) pairs retrying 4-12× over
   4+ hours with no FSM guard.  This test pins the
   observability surface that surfaces those retries directly
   to Prometheus instead of leaving them buried in log lines:

     1. The first start of any (keeper, turn_id) is [Fresh] —
        no reattempt counter increment.
     2. The same id starting again classifies as [Reattempt]
        and increments [masc_keeper_turn_reattempts_total].
        [previous_attempts] grows by 1 per reattempt.
     3. Advancing the turn id resets bookkeeping — a normal
        forward progression must NOT count as reattempt.
     4. A turn id moving strictly backwards classifies as
        [Regression] (write_meta race symptom #9733) and
        increments the regression counter.
     5. Per-keeper isolation: keeper A's reattempts do not
        leak into keeper B's counters even with identical
        turn ids.
     6. [seconds_since_first_attempt] returns the time since
        the FIRST start of the current turn id (so a future
        gate can compute "stuck for X minutes" without
        re-deriving the timeline).
     7. The guard blocks attempt 4 when [max_attempts=3],
        gates on stuck age, and resets on forward turn advance.
