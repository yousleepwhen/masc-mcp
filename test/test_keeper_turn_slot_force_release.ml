(** Force-release path for [Keeper_turn_slot.force_release_holder_for].

    Goal: prove the supervisor escape hatch correctly drops the holder
    row and increments the matching semaphore when a keeper fiber has
    not returned through the natural [Fun.protect] release. The
    motivating production incident was 16 keepers holding
    [reactive_slot] for 18-25 minutes behind LLM subprocess hangs,
    [reactive_available=0], and the entire fleet starved on
    [acquire_bounded].

    These tests are pure in-memory state checks; they do not exercise
    the supervisor wiring (covered by the integration build). *)
