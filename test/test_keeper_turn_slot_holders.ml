(** Diagnostic accessor smoke tests for [Keeper_turn_slot.*_slot_holders].

    Goal: prove the holder snapshot API surfaces the keeper currently
    holding a slot, sorted by descending hold time. This is the data
    that operators need when [turn_available=0] starves the fleet — the
    longest-holding peer is the actual blocker.

    The tests run inside [Eio_main.run] because [with_keeper_turn_slot_for_test]
    requires an Eio fiber context (Eio.Mutex on holder_table). *)

(* Reviewer #13190: existing tests exercise force_release_stale_holder
   while the outer fiber's protect-finalizer eventually runs to
   completion.  The watchdog restart path looks different — the
   supervisor force-releases the slot from outside the stale fiber,
   the stale fiber raises before normal cleanup, and a replacement
   keeper takes the slot under the same keeper_name.  Pin that the
   replacement's acquire/release cycle is unaffected by any leftover
   marker from the previous generation: both semaphores must return
   to baseline even after the outer fiber exits via exception, and a
   fresh acquisition under the same keeper_name must complete cleanly
   with semaphores still at baseline. *)
