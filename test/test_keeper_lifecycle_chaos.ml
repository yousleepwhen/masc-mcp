(** Keeper Lifecycle Chaos Tests — fault injection through the registry.

    Tests the integration between keeper_registry.dispatch_event and
    keeper_state_machine.apply_event by simulating the exact event
    sequences that keeper_keepalive and keeper_supervisor produce.

    Fills the gap between pure FSM unit tests (98 tests) and manual E2E.

    @since 2.261.0 — Production readiness audit, Issue #4 *)
