(* test/test_anti_rationalization_gate2_advisory_10113.ml

   #10113: anti-rationalization gate 2 used to terminal-reject any
   completion notes containing one of 13 substrings — "pre-existing",
   "follow-up", "out of scope", etc.  Substring matching has no
   word-boundary or context awareness, so legitimate engineering
   notes ("fixed bug X; pre-existing issue #1234 tracked separately",
   "filed a follow-up ticket for the optimization layer") were
   rejected before the LLM evaluator could see them.

   The fix demoted gate 2 to an advisory hint by default.  This
   test pins the resulting state machine WITHOUT calling the LLM
   evaluator (Gate 3 needs an OAS cascade we don't stand up here),
   so the assertions focus on:

     1. The Prometheus counter labels are correct for each
        decision branch — operators read these to triangulate
        false-positive rate vs true-positive rate per pattern.
     2. The build_prompt advisory section appears with the
        flagged phrase + reason exactly when an excuse_advisory
        is supplied.
     3. The advisory section is ABSENT when no advisory is
        supplied — no leakage of the gate-2 message into normal
        prompts.
     4. The advisory text guides the LLM to evaluate in context
        rather than treating the phrase as automatic grounds for
        rejection — the explicit "approve if substantive work and
        normal engineering context" instruction is the contract.
