(** test_keeper_fsm_joints — Cross-FSM joint behavior tests.

    Mirrors the SafetyInvariant conjuncts from
    [specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperCompositeLifecycle.tla] (lines
    354-377) into OCaml tests that drive the actual production
    predicates [Keeper_composite_observer.check_*] over the full state
    cross-product, plus mutation tests mirroring the TLA+ BugAction
    patterns (lines 410-432).

    Coverage gap before this file: existing
    [test_keeper_composite_observer.ml] only verifies the Prometheus
    bump mechanism (given a synthetic [invariants_check], does the
    counter increment?). It does NOT exercise the predicates that
    decide whether each invariant holds. This file closes that gap.

    Out of scope here:
    - Liveness invariants ([]<> properties from TLA+ lines 388-404).
      TLC owns those; OCaml finite-trace tests are not the right tool.
    - [check_event_priority_monotone] — registry-bound, requires a
      full {!Keeper_registry.registry_entry}; covered by
      [test_keeper_composite_observer.ml] integration paths instead.
    - End-to-end {!Keeper_unified_turn.run_keeper_cycle} drive — needs
      Coord.config + meta + observation + OAS env. Separate trail. *)
