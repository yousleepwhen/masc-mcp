(** RFC-0128 §6.3 integration test — sandbox keeper write at one
    clone of a repository joins, via canonical URL slug, with an IDE
    read at a different clone of the same upstream.

    Setup:
      base_dir/
        .masc/config/repositories.toml
          [repository.sandbox]   url=https://github.com/owner/repo
                                 local_path = base_dir/sandbox/repos/repo
          [repository.worktree]  url=git@github.com:owner/repo.git
                                 local_path = base_dir/workspace/repo
        sandbox/repos/repo/lib/foo.ml
        workspace/repo/lib/foo.ml

    Invariant: when the keeper "writes" inside the sandbox clone, the
    record must be retrievable when the IDE reads from the working
    tree clone — both must resolve to the same [By_url <slug>]
    partition. The repo URLs use different transports (HTTPS vs SSH)
    on purpose to also exercise the normalisation join test from
    {!Ide_paths.canonical_url_of_remote}. *)
