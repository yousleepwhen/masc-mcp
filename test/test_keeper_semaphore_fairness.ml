(** Regression tests for autonomous semaphore fairness cooldown (#6810).

    Background: janitor completed 9 consecutive ~20s turns while
    cheolsu/sangsu/masc-improver/uranium666 all hit the 60s autonomous
    semaphore wait timeout.  The queue is FIFO-fair in isolation, but a
    fast-cycling keeper that re-enters the queue immediately after
    releasing the semaphore outruns peers whose heartbeat intervals are
    longer.

    Fix: [maybe_yield_for_fairness] stamps each autonomous-turn
    completion, then checks before re-enqueueing: if other keepers are
    waiting AND this keeper completed within [autonomous_fairness_cooldown_sec]
    seconds ago, it yields for the remaining cooldown window.

    These tests exercise [fairness_delay_sec_at] — the pure delay-
    computation extracted from [maybe_yield_for_fairness] — so we never
    need to actually sleep in a test. *)

module KK = Masc_mcp.Keeper_keepalive

(** Reset both the completion table and the FIFO wait queue between tests.

    Keeper_keepalive now uses Eio.Mutex (was Stdlib.Mutex; the latter
    raised EDEADLK under any fiber contention). All public entries
    require an Eio fiber context, so each test runs inside Eio_main.run.
    Tests that need [env] or [sw] take the unit-arg form and fetch them
    via [Eio.Stdenv.*] inside [body_with_env]. *)
