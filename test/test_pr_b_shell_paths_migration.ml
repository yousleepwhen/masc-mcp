(** RFC-0084 host-config-cleanup-B — shell binary path migration.

    PR-B migrates the absolute literals for the host bash + zsh
    binaries to the typed [Host_config.host_bash] / [host_zsh]
    fields.

    bash sites:
    - none: tool_execute is Shell-IR based and no longer keeps a
      module-local host_bash binding

    zsh sites:
    - none: keeper PR review wrappers are retired from active routing,
      and the remaining legacy helpers no longer keep module-local zsh
      bindings

    Each module has its own module-init binding (rather than one
    shared SSOT) because the modules don't share a common ancestor
    other than [Host_config] itself, and per-module bindings keep
    the dependency local.

    Behaviour byte-identical today; a future PR can flip
    [Host_config.host] to PATH-resolved binaries
    for NixOS / Alpine portability without touching this PR's call
    sites.

    Background auto-promotion tests were removed with the legacy
    tool_execute background surface, so no [lib/exec/test/] bash
    fixture is exempted here. *)
