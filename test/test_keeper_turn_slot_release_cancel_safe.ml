(* test/test_keeper_turn_slot_release_cancel_safe.ml

   Regression guard for the 2026-05-05 fleet-stuck cycle:
   [release_keeper_turn_slot] called bookkeeping functions
   (drop_autonomous_waiter / drop_holder / record_autonomous_completion)
   directly. These functions use [Eio.Mutex.use_rw ~protect:true],
   which can raise [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] when the fiber is being
   torn down. Because the call sat in a [Fun.protect ~finally]
   block, the [Eio.Semaphore.release] line was never reached and
   the slot leaked permanently — turn_available pinned at 0 while
   the entire 14-keeper fleet skipped turns with "wait > 180s".

   The fix keeps each bookkeeping failure isolated from the semaphore
   release: standalone cleanup callbacks go through [safe_bookkeeping ~op],
   while recorded-holder cleanup catches [consume_force_release] failures
   inside [release_recorded_holder]. Both paths now emit a metric before
   continuing. This test asserts the structural pattern by anchored
   substring search, so a future refactor that removes the guard fails CI
   before it deadlocks production.

   Why structural rather than behavioural: deterministically
   raising Cancelled inside a sub-mutex during fiber teardown
   requires a non-trivial Eio.Switch + Cancel.protect harness.
   The fix mirrors the prior-art pattern in
   [lib/keeper/keeper_unified_turn.ml] (issue #9747), so the
   regression risk we guard against is "someone removes the
   wrap", which a substring assertion catches cheaply. *)
