(** Integration pin for PR-2 of the [Keeper_cwd_response] series.

    Asserts that the helper functions wired into
    [keeper_sandbox_docker.ml] response builders produce the
    in-container path (not the host abs path) when composed.

    Background: PR #11080 removed [sandbox_host_root] /
    [playground_path] from [execution_context], but sibling
    [cwd] response fields in Docker bash routes still echoed the host abs path.
    PR-1 introduced [Keeper_cwd_response]; this PR (PR-2)
    replaces the four [("cwd", `String cwd)] literals with
    [Keeper_cwd_response.to_yojson_response]. This test pins
    the composition contract so a future refactor cannot
    silently revert to host-path echo. *)
