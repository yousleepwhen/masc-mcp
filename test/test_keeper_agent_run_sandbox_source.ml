(** Structural guard for keeper provider-CLI sandbox cwd.

    Keeper-internal tools are sandbox-aware, but provider-native CLI tools
    such as Shell/ReadFile inherit the CLI transport cwd. If that cwd falls
    back to the server process cwd, Docker-profile keepers can dirty the repo
    root instead of their playground. This pins the handoff point into OAS. *)

     fail with No such file or directory inside the container.
