(** [excuse_patterns_writeback] — pin the disk write-back contract for
    [load_excuse_patterns].

    Before this fix the migration from legacy English-only patterns to
    the current built-in defaults happened in memory only.  Every boot
    re-read the same stale on-disk file, re-ran the migration, and
    re-emitted the INFO log line.  The dashboard administrator surface
    that lets operators see the active patterns ([GET
    /api/v1/dashboard/config/excuse-patterns]) returned the migrated
    list while the file on disk continued to advertise the legacy
    snapshot — a quiet divergence between operator-visible state and
    the persisted source of truth.

    This test fixes that contract: after one [load_excuse_patterns]
    call the on-disk file must reflect the migrated list, so a second
    boot (or a fresh process) loads the current defaults directly with
    no migration step at all. *)
