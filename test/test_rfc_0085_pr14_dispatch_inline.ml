(** RFC-0085 PR-14 — Verify the file-private [dispatch] /
    [dispatch_structured] chain is gone from tool_dispatch.ml; only
    [guarded_dispatch] (and its mli-exported helpers) remains.

    Original PR-14 test used [count_calls] (application sites) to
    approximate "no definition", which is indirect.  This revision
    uses [count_value_bindings] (Ppat_var nodes — actual definitions)
    so the assertion is direct: top-level [let dispatch = ...] and
    [let dispatch_structured = ...] must not exist in tool_dispatch.ml. *)
