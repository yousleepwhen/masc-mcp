(** Integration pin for PR-3 of the [Keeper_cwd_response] series.

    PR-3 wires [Keeper_cwd_response.to_yojson_response] into the
    sandbox-backend response builders inside [keeper_workspace_read_ops.ml]:

    - [render_sandbox_process_result] (op=pwd / git_status / git_log / ...)
    - [op="git_log"] runtime branch (1 cwd-echo site under backend [via])

    All other [cwd] usages in the file are intentionally left
    unchanged:

    - [~fields:] / [~extra:] params to [error_json] / [Log.Keeper.*]
      (operator-facing — host path is what operators ssh into)
    - [tool_execute] Local-execution branch in [agent_tool_execute_runtime.ml];
      for Local keepers the host path IS the keeper-visible path
    - [op] read-style ops with a [path] field (no [cwd] in
      response Assoc — those echo the input target, separate
      concern)
    This test is the source-level guard that pins the wired
    sites. The runtime composition contract is already pinned
    by [test_keeper_cwd_response] (PR-1) and
    [test_keeper_sandbox_docker_cwd_response] (PR-2). *)
