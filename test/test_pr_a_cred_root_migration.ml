(** RFC-0084 host-config-cleanup-A — credential root migration.

    PR-A delegates [Keeper_host_config_provider.cred_root] to
    [Host_config.host ().cred_root] instead of the
    ad-hoc literal ["/tmp/keeper-creds"], establishing a single
    source of truth for the constant.

    Behaviour is byte-identical today; the migration is structural
    (single literal -> typed surface) so that subsequent PRs can flip
    [Host_config.host] to a [resolve ~base_path]-relative
    value without touching [keeper_host_config_provider.ml]. *)
