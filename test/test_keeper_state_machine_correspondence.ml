(** test_keeper_state_machine_correspondence — OCaml ↔ TLA+ field-set
    correspondence harness for KeeperStateMachine (P5).

    Mechanically detects spec-code SHAPE divergence: for each event,
    cross-checks the set of [conditions] fields modified by the OCaml
    [update_conditions] function against the set of primed-variable
    assignments in the matching TLA+ action.

    Background
    ----------
    The original [manual_reconcile_required] one-way trap (pre-#7334)
    was a single-line spec-code divergence that hid in plain sight:
    the TLA+ [TurnSucceeded] action cleared the latch but the OCaml
    handler did not. The TLA+ liveness property still passed under the
    spec's own (drifted) semantics, so TLC could not catch it. After
    PR #7334 removed the latch entirely from both sides, the audit
    [docs/tla-audit/state-fsm-gap-2026-04-13.md] kept proposal P5 open:
    "Add an OCaml-TLA+ correspondence test" so any future single-field
    divergence is caught mechanically at test time.

    What this test checks
    ---------------------
    SHAPE only — for each event, the set of [conditions] field names
    modified must equal the set of variable names that are primed-
    assigned in the corresponding TLA+ action. Value-level
    correspondence (does TLA+ set TRUE when OCaml sets true?) is
    enforced by the existing per-event unit tests in
    [test_keeper_state_machine.ml] plus the snapshot trace in
    [synthetic.tla-trace.jsonl]; we deliberately do not duplicate it.

    Method
    ------
    OCaml side: for each [event], run [update_conditions] on two bases
    (all-fields-false and all-fields-true) and take the union of field
    diffs from [conditions_to_json]. The two-base union guarantees we
    observe writes regardless of the value the event happens to set.

    TLA+ side: read [specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperStateMachine.tla],
    slice out the Events section (between the "Events" header and the
    "Next State" header), parse each [Name == ... /\ var' = ... ]
    action, and collect primed-variable names. Restricting the slice
    keeps property definitions like [restart_count' >= restart_count]
    out of the parser.

    Modeling-boundary filter
    ------------------------
    A few TLA+ variables exist purely for spec liveness/monotonicity
    properties and are not part of the OCaml [conditions] record (the
    supervisor owns them, not the FSM). Comparing those would produce
    false-positives, so the harness compares only the intersection of
    each side's variable set with the OCaml [conditions] field names.
    The set of OCaml [conditions] fields is itself derived from
    [conditions_to_json], so adding a new field automatically extends
    the comparison without touching this test. *)
