(** Structural guard for issue #8391 HIGH #1.

    The keeper pause/resume HTTP handlers in
    [lib/server/server_dashboard_http_keeper_api.ml] used to fold
    [Ok None] (keeper meta vanished) and [Error _] (IO/parse failure)
    into a single silent no-op arm. The dashboard endpoint then
    returned HTTP 200 OK and the operator believed the keeper was
    paused, while it kept running.

    These tests are intentionally structural (read the source file and
    assert patterns) rather than integration. Mocking [read_meta] would
    require spinning up the full server and a fake meta file.

    Cases covered:

    - (a) happy [Ok (Some meta)] arm exists in both closures
    - (b) [Ok None] arm exists separately and is observable (logs +
          counter or non-200 response)
    - (c) [Error _] arm exists separately and is observable (logs +
          counter or 500 response)
    - (d) the silent fold ["Ok None | Error _"] does not return at the
          known offending sites in [persist_keeper_paused_state] /
          [resume_booted_keeper_if_needed] / directive [meta_opt]
