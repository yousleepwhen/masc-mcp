(** RFC-0085 PR-12 — Misleading underscore prefix removed from
    [_tool_spec_*] bindings.  The underscore prefix is OCaml's
    convention for *intentionally unused* bindings, but these tool_spec
    lists are *actively used* (List.mem checks in each Tool_*.ml
    registration).  Renamed to drop the prefix so the convention
    matches reality.

    Original PR-12 test scanned [count_string_literals], which only
    examines [Pconst_string] nodes — identifiers are NOT string
    literals, so the test passed trivially regardless of the rename.
    This revision uses [count_value_bindings_with_prefix], which
    inspects [Ppat_var] nodes (actual identifier bindings). *)
