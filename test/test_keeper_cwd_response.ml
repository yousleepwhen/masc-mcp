(** Property tests for [Keeper_cwd_response].

    These pin the contract that LLM-facing JSON responses
    constructed via {!Keeper_cwd_response.to_yojson_response}
    never reveal the host abs path of a Docker-backend keeper.

    Background: PR #11080 removed [sandbox_host_root] /
    [playground_path] from [execution_context], but sibling
    [cwd] fields in [keeper_sandbox_docker] / [agent_tool_command_runtime]
    response builders still echoed the host abs path. The Docker
    [--workdir] argument was translated via
    [docker_private_workspace_cwd], yet that translation was not
    propagated into the response JSON, so the LLM re-emitted
    [cd /Users/...] on the next turn — invalid inside the
    container.

    These tests are the layer-1 guard: they pin the audience
    semantics of the [Keeper_cwd_response] module itself. The
    layer-2/3 guards (response builders + MLI gate) live in
    follow-up PRs. *)
