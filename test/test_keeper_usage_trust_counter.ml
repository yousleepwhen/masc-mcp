   #9959 defensive layer test: verify the new [record_usage_trust]
   helper increments the right Prometheus counters for each
   [usage_trust] variant and isolates labels across keepers.

   The upstream root cause (accumulated values leaking into
   per-response api_usage) is tracked in jeong-sik/oas#1181; the
   counters here surface the anomaly rate so operators can alert
   while that fix is in-flight. *)
