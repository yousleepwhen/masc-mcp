(* test/test_context_max_observed_9953.ml

   #9953: same model label was recording 3 different
   [context_max] values across turns (cli_tool_d:auto getting
   42% / 17% / 41% split between 64k / 262k / 1M).  The data was
   in the JSONL ledger but invisible to Prometheus dashboards.

   This test pins:
     1. The [context_max_bucket] string vocabulary — dashboards
        and runbooks key off these literals, so a future change
        is an explicit decision.
     2. Boundary behaviour for each bucket transition (off-by-
        one regression guard).
     3. The counter increments on the bucket inferred from the
        observed value, on the redacted runtime lane.
     4. Per-keeper bucket isolation — a turn that lands in [200k]
        must not leak into the [256k] bucket for the same keeper.

   The point of the metric is that
   [count by (model_used, resolved_model_id)
            (masc_keeper_context_max_observed_total)] returning
   > 1 directly indicates drift. MASC emits the redacted ["runtime"]
   lane for both labels. Test #4 pins this counting contract by
   exercising two distinct buckets for one runtime-lane tuple. *)
