(** Coverage tests for #6637 iter11 — per-agent playground containment
    in [Tool_code.validate_read_path].

    These tests drive the helper through a fresh tmp [base_path] with
    a real `git init` (required by [Tool_code.validate_path] which
    asserts git root) and two playground bundles. Each case exercises
    one branch of the two-tier gate:

    1. Shared codebase (outside .masc/playground/) → allow.
    2. Inside .masc/playground/<caller>/ → allow.
    3. Inside .masc/playground/<other>/ → reject with named SSOT.
    4. Outside git root → reject with the pre-iter11 [validate_path]
       boundary error. *)
