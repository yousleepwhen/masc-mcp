(* Phase 2 Action 4 — confirm the 30s Dashboard_cache wrapping holds.
   Two back-to-back calls with the same actor must return byte-identical
   payload (same [generated_at] timestamp); a different actor must
   compute a fresh payload (different cache key).  We do not assert
   exact compute count because the underlying Tool_unified.summary_report
   has no observable counter — same-payload is the cleanest invariant.

   This protects against a regression where the cache key drops the
   actor, which would leak permission-scoped tool inventories across
   agents. *)
