(* test/test_reqd_invalid_state_swallow.ml

   Regression guard for the 2026-05-05 cycle9 FATAL incident:

   [httpun.Reqd.respond_with_string: invalid state, currently handling error]

   When a client disconnects during a long OAS turn (≥40s), httpun's
   error_handler fires and transitions the Reqd into "handling error" state.
   Any subsequent call to [Httpun.Reqd.respond_with_string] on the same Reqd
   raises [Failure "...invalid state..."].

   Before the fix:
   - [http_server_eio.ml] called [Httpun.Reqd.respond_with_string] directly
     with no guard.  The [Failure] escaped through [make_extended_handler]'s
     [with exn -> Http.Response.internal_error] fallback — because that fallback
     itself calls [respond_with_string], which also fails, and the secondary
     [Failure] was unhandled.
   - More critically, [server_mcp_transport_http.ml] forks a fiber with
     [runtime.sw] (a server-level switch) for the actual OAS POST handling.
     When [respond_with_string] raised [Failure] in that fiber, it failed
     [runtime.sw], which is NOT wrapped by the per-connection try/with.
     This propagated to the server-level Eio switch → [try_start] catch-all
     → "[FATAL] Unhandled exception" → [exit 1] → cycle restart.

   The fix:
   1. [lib/http_server_eio.ml]: [safe_respond_with_string] wrapper — all
      response helpers ([Response.text], [Response.json], etc.) and the
      [Request.respond_error] family go through this wrapper.
   2. [bin/main_eio.ml]: [safe_reqd_respond] local helper guards every direct
      [Httpun.Reqd.respond_with_string] call; [make_extended_handler] re-raises
      [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] instead of swallowing it; the error fallback has
      a redundant guard for defence-in-depth.
   3. [lib/server/server_mcp_transport_http_respond.ml]: safe wrapper added to
      all MCP error response factories (the helpers called from the forked fiber).
   4. [lib/server/server_mcp_transport_http.ml]: safe wrapper used for all
      direct [respond_with_string] calls in the critical POST/GET/DELETE
      handlers (especially the OAS-executing forked fiber at [Eio.Fiber.fork
      ~sw:(runtime.sw)]).
   5. [lib/server/server_ws_standalone.ml]: [Ws.Wsd.send_pong] wrapped so the
      "cannot write to closed writer" race is explicit.

   This test asserts the presence of these defensive patterns in the source so
   a future refactor that silently removes them fails CI before it can re-arm
   the FATAL restart loop. *)
