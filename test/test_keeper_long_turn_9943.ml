(* test/test_keeper_long_turn_9943.ml

   #9943 reports a 20-minute turn where the post-turn
   compaction step appears to no-op and the turn keeps
   running.  Several adjacent issues report the same
   "long-running turn that nobody noticed" symptom from
   different angles (#9982 trust pause, #10121 livelock).

   This test pins the observability surface that surfaces
   such turns directly to Prometheus instead of leaving
   the duration trapped in a single info log line:

     1. The bucket vocabulary is bounded to five labels
        ([under_60s | 60-300s | 300-600s | 600-1200s |
        over_1200s]) so [keeper × bucket] cardinality is
        bounded at runtime.
     2. Bucket boundaries are inclusive on the lower end
        (60_000 ms classifies as [60-300s], 600_000 ms as
        [600-1200s], 1_200_000 ms as [over_1200s]).
     3. [record_turn_latency_bucket] increments the matching
        bucket counter and is keeper-isolated.
     4. The WARN threshold reads
        [MASC_KEEPER_LONG_TURN_WARN_MS] on each call (default
        600_000 = 10 min) so operators can dial it without
        a restart.
