   #10101: [Config.raw_all_tool_schemas] is the authoritative
   list consumed by [Tool_help_registry.find_entry].  #9912
   patched only [Tool_shard.base_tools] (5 always-present
   tools), leaving 11 other shard categories unregistered so
   [masc_tool_help(keeper_task_claim)] returned "unknown tool"
   despite the dispatcher handling the tool correctly.

   This test asserts the registry invariant: every schema exported
   by [Tool_shard.all_keeper_tool_schemas] is resolvable from
   [Config.raw_all_tool_schemas].  If a new shard category is
   introduced and forgotten at the aggregation site, or if a
   future refactor re-introduces the patch-local
   [@ Tool_shard.base_tools] pattern, this test surfaces it
   immediately by name.

   Also pins the specific cases called out in the issue: the
   11 shard categories each have a representative tool name
   that must round-trip through [find_entry]. *)

(* Module init runs Cdal_verdict_gate.default_base_path at
