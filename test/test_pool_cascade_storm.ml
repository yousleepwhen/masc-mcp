(* RFC-0107 Phase D.2e — cascade-storm reproducer.

   Live integration test for the connection pool's keep-alive
   contract. An in-process cohttp-eio server takes the role of a
   provider endpoint; 16 concurrent fibers each issue 5 sequential
   requests (80 total) against the same {scheme, host, port}.

   The assertion the pool must satisfy: post-burst pool stats show
   [reuse_count_total] dominating [create_count_total]. With the
   pre-D.2 [make_closing_client] workaround (one fresh TCP+TLS
   session per call), [create_count_total = 80, reuse_count_total = 0],
   which is the cascade-fd-storm anti-pattern RFC-0107 §1.1 names. With
   the D.2 pool, [create_count_total] is bounded by [max_idle_per_host]
   (default 8) and most requests reuse parked connections.

   This test is the Phase F retirement-gate input: it gives a
   deterministic, in-process witness that the D fix actually removes
   the connection-burst pressure that RFC-0101 throttle was patching.

   Limitations:
   - Loopback HTTP only (no TLS) — TLS handshake cost is part of the
     production pressure but is not what the pool reuse contract
     touches. The reuse counter is transport-agnostic.
   - The mock server runs on plain HTTP; piaf still issues HTTP/1.1
     keep-alive. The Host_key normalisation path is exercised
     end-to-end (Uri parse → Host_key.of_uri → per-host queue
     lookup). *)

(* The server is given an explicit [stop] promise so the test
   drives shutdown deterministically. [Eio.Fiber.fork_daemon] would
   cancel the accept loop at switch teardown, but cohttp-eio's
   accept loop can hold the switch alive on cancel as it drains
   in-flight connections; an explicit promise sidesteps that race. *)
