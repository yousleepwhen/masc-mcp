(** RFC-0084 host-config-cleanup-C — coreutils path migration.

    PR-C migrated the 6 absolute binary path literals used by
    workspace read ops (pwd / ls / cat / head / tail / wc)
    to the typed [Host_config.coreutils] record field.  The single
    [let coreutils = (Host_config.host ()).coreutils]
    binding in [keeper_workspace_ops_setup.ml] is the only [Host_config] call.

    Behaviour is byte-identical today; the migration establishes a
    single source of truth so a future PR can flip
    [Host_config.host] to PATH-resolved binaries
    for Alpine / BusyBox / Talos portability.

    Pins:
    - 0 occurrences of any of the 6 absolute literals in
      [keeper_workspace_ops.ml], [keeper_workspace_read_ops.ml], or
      [keeper_workspace_ops_setup.ml] (regression guard)
    - [Host_config.host] is invoked exactly once
      from the setup module (positive assertion + no per-call-site
      regression)
    - Byte-identical equality between the bound [coreutils] field
      and the typed surface (cross-check) *)
