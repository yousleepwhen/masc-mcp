(** #9943 facet 1: compaction-triggered-but-no-savings counter.

    Production audit (2026-04-24) found 956/972 = 98.4% of compaction
    snapshots had [compaction_before_tokens =
    compaction_after_tokens > 0] — the trigger fired but the strategy
    did not reduce the token budget.  [masc_keeper_compactions_total]
    counts trigger fires, not savings, so the noop rate was invisible
    on dashboards.

    [Keeper_unified_metrics.append_metrics_snapshot] now emits
    [masc_keeper_compaction_noop_total{keeper, trigger}] in addition
    to writing the JSONL row.  Full integration testing requires a
    keeper context + run_result + observation, which is heavier than
    a unit test should be — these tests pin the metric surface and
    label shape so a future refactor cannot silently flip the
    cardinality or rename the labels. *)

(* Metric is registered at module init via [Prometheus.add ~labels:[]],
   so [get_metric_value ~labels:[] ()] returns [Some 0.0] iff the
   registration ran. If a future refactor accidentally drops the
   [add metric_keeper_compaction_noop ...] call, this returns [None]
   and the dashboard silently flattens — pin the registration.

   [metric_total] is unsuitable as a check: it folds across all
   labelled variants and returns [0.0] for both "not registered" and
   "registered but no observations yet". *)
