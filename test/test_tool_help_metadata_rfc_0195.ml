(* test/test_tool_help_metadata_rfc_0195.ml

   RFC-0195 P0 — help_entry record gains two optional, additive
   metadata fields: [examples] and [alternatives]. These fields
   exist so LLMs can recover from workflow_rejection / governance
   denial / catalog miss without parsing prose hints (RFC-0194 §2).

   This test pins:
   - The six target tools curated in this PR carry non-empty
     [examples] (so the LLM has a concrete invocation template).
   - The four tools whose semantics name a sibling carry a
     non-empty [alternatives] list (so the LLM has a typed next
     step on rejection). The remaining curated tools that are
     genuinely terminal (keeper_memory_write, masc_plan_set_task)
     are pinned as having an empty alternatives list — the
     expectation is "no sibling exists", not "we forgot to fill
     it in".
   - Every name listed in any [alternatives] field resolves
     through [find_entry] against the authoritative schema list,
     so an alternatives entry can never become a dangling
     reference at the source of truth.

   Same MASC_BASE_PATH setenv pattern as
   test_tool_help_registry_shard_coverage_10101.ml — module init
   triggers Cdal_verdict_gate.default_base_path which raises
   under HOME. *)

(* The six target tools listed in RFC-0195 P0 cover two
   reachability classes:
   - Four are registered in Config.raw_all_tool_schemas and
     therefore round-trip through find_entry. Those are the
     ones this test pins.
   - Two (masc_worktree_create, masc_plan_set_task) are
     coordination-side tools whose schemas live on a different
     surface that this PR does not modify. Their manual_help
     entries are written here as future-proofing — they take
     effect the moment those schemas join the keeper-side
     registry. See PR body §"Reachable surface" for the split. *)
