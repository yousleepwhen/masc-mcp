(* OCaml-side regression guard for RFC-0065 §3.2.3
 * WireinOrderPinned invariant (PR #14632).
 *
 * The TLA+ spec KeeperPostTurnOrchestration.tla asserts that the
 * post-turn wirein sequence must be exactly <A5, A6, K4b, K1>, which
 * maps to the OCaml call order:
 *
 *   apply_autonomous_wirein     (A5)
 *   apply_resilience_wirein     (A6)
 *   apply_tool_emission_wirein  (K4b)
 *   apply_multimodal_wirein     (K1)
 *
 * The TLC layer (clean + buggy cfg) regression-guards this at the
 * model level. This test is the OCaml-side analogue: a structural
 * scan over [lib/keeper/keeper_post_turn.ml] that confirms the four
 * wirein calls appear in the correct order inside the body of
 * [apply_post_turn_lifecycle_with_resilience_handles]. An accidental
 * reorder would otherwise compile cleanly and silently violate the
 * pinned invariant.
 *
 * Approach: read the source file as text, locate the function
 * definition by header line, then within a window of lines below
 * that header look up the first occurrence of each of the four
 * literal call markers and assert the line numbers are strictly
 * increasing. The window size is generous (300 lines) because the
 * function body is long; the four markers occur exactly once each
 * inside the body, so the window can safely overshoot.
 *)
