(** Parity gate between [Agent_tool_voice_runtime.voice_command]
    enumeration and the [keeper_voice_*] entries registered in
    [Agent_tool_descriptor.all_descriptors].

    The previous string-classifier wiring (raw [match name with
    "keeper_voice_speak" -> ...]) had no compiler-level link between
    descriptor registration and handler dispatch — adding one without
    the other was a silent dispatch hole.

    This test pins both sides against each other so that a future
    addition of a [keeper_voice_*] descriptor without a matching
    [voice_command] variant (or vice versa) is rejected at test
    time. *)
