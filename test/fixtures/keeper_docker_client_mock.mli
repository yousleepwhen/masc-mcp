(** RFC-0070 Phase 3b-iv.1b — Mock {!Keeper_docker_client.S}.

    Test-fixture implementation: pre-registered FIFO queues of expected
    [(input, response)] pairs. Calls without a matching injection
    return [Error Daemon_unreachable] (typed, never a silent
    exception). Resetting the queues between tests is the caller's
    responsibility via {!reset}.

    Reference: docs/rfc/RFC-0070-keeper-sandbox-pure-edge-separation.md §3.2

    Determinism contract: same injection sequence + same call sequence
    ⇒ identical [response] sequence. No clock, no Random, no I/O. The
    only mutable state is the per-method injection queue, which is
    explicitly reset by tests. *)

(** [inject_run plan response] enqueues [response] to be returned when
    {!run} is called with a plan that equals [plan] (via
    [Keeper_sandbox_oneshot_plan.equal]).

    Strict FIFO: only the *front* of the queue is consulted. If the
    incoming plan does not equal the front, the queue is NOT scanned
    further — the call returns [Error Daemon_unreachable] and the
    queue is left intact. This guarantees test-failure on
    out-of-order or unexpected calls instead of papering them over. *)

(** [inject_info_security_options response] enqueues [response] to be

(** [inject_run_detached response] enqueues [response] to override the

    [run_detached] queue is not a fail-closed error — it yields the
    deterministic [Ok plan.container_name]. Use this only to inject an
    [Error] (or a non-default [Ok]) for a failure / variation test. *)
