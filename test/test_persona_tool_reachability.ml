(** test_persona_tool_reachability — Step 15 partial.

    Locks the Step 9 (research preset = delivery) capability decision
    so a future PR cannot silently narrow research-tier keepers' tool
    surface without failing this test.

    The Step 9 unblock at [config/tool_policy.toml]
    [\[presets.research\]] is what makes delivery-class filesystem,
    file-search, and execute tooling reach the research-tier toolset.  Before Step
    9, analyst / scholar / verifier keepers could only share opinions on
    the board.  After Step 9, the capability is opened and the
    risk-tiered approval gate still queues high-risk ops for operator
    confirmation.  This test is the regression sentinel for that
    decision. *)
