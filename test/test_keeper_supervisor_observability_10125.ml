(* test/test_keeper_supervisor_observability_10125.ml

   #10125 reports a 4h+ silent fleet death after server
   restart: 14 keepers exit on cascade exhaustion and the
   supervisor sweep never restarts (the
   "keeper supervisor sweep started" log line is missing
   for the entire post-restart session).

   The deeper fix is to remove the conditional gate on
   [maybe_start_supervisor_sweep] so the sweep starts
   unconditionally during server boot.  This test covers
   the observability half: a counter that advances each
   time the Pulse actually starts, and a gauge that
   advances on every sweep beat.  Operators alert on:

     - counter_starts == 0 after a server restart
       (sweep never came up); and
     - now - last_sweep_unixtime > 2 × interval
       (sweep stalled).

   Pulse-driven integration is too heavy for a unit test
   (needs Eio switch, clock, full ctx) so the tests below
   exercise the metric surface and helper directly.  The
   wiring inside [start_supervisor_sweep] is verified by
   reading the diff: counter increments before the log
   line, gauge sets before AND after each beat.

   dashboard wiring is present — if either name is missing the whole
   dashboard becomes invisible on a fresh install.
