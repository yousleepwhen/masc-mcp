   #9629: Governance compute_judgments and Operator compute_judgments
   were calling [Masc_oas_bridge.run_safe] directly with a timeout
   resolved from the legacy [Env_config.Inference.{operator,
   dashboard_governance}_judge_timeout_seconds] readers.  Operator_judge
   in particular fell back to the 30s global inference timeout — far
   below the observed p50 of LLM-via-OAS-worker calls — and produced
   the "Execution timed out after 60.0s" warnings reported in the
   issue.  Governance_judge had a 300s default but lived outside the
   per-caller Prometheus counter.

   #13113 follow-up: live /Users/dancer/me evidence showed the opposite
   failure mode once both judges shared the 300s worker default: a dashboard
   governance judge can pin a CLI-backed child for minutes and make operator
   surfaces / health checks stale.  Dashboard judges are advisory, so their
   checked-in default is now bounded separately while env overrides stay
   available.

   This test pins:

     1. Both judges resolve to [dashboard_judge_default_sec] by default,
        instead of inheriting the generic 300s worker budget.
     2. Removed pre-SSOT env vars
        ([MASC_OPERATOR_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SEC],
        [MASC_DASHBOARD_GOVERNANCE_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_SEC]) are ignored.
     3. The canonical per-caller env var
        ([MASC_OAS_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_GOVERNANCE_JUDGE_SEC] etc.) is the
        only per-judge override surface. *)

(* The PR's stated invariant is "dashboard judges resolve to a
   bounded 45.0s default, not the 300s worker budget".  Pin the
   numeric value of [dashboard_judge_default_sec] explicitly.
   Without this anchor, a future widen back toward the worker
   budget would still pass the existing
   [judge resolves to dashboard_judge_default_sec] checks because
   both sides of the comparison would shift in lockstep. *)
