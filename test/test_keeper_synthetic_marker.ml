(** test_keeper_synthetic_marker — SSOT for the [SYNTHETIC] marker.

    Pre-fix the literal ["[SYNTHETIC]"] was hardcoded in three files
    (keeper_memory_policy producer, keeper_memory_bank +
    agent_tool_memory_runtime consumers).  This test pins the SSOT contract so
    a marker rename or accidental case-shift cannot silently break the
    producer-consumer detection pair. *)
