(** #7883 — Structural + behavioural tests that every OAS Agent
    builder / run_named site in MASC installs an approval_callback.

    Background: OAS emits [WARN] "ApprovalRequired but no approval
    callback — executing" when an agent has [approval = None] and a
    tool marked ApprovalRequired is called. The tool executes anyway
    (fail-open). #7883 observed two fleet events where the WARN fired
    and the tool ran. Log promotion to ERROR via [oas_log_bridge] is
    observability, not a gate.

    This test locks the wiring in:

    1. Behavioural: [Approval_callbacks.reject_by_default] returns
       [Reject _] for any tool, so any Builder that accidentally
       defaults to it will fail loudly instead of executing.
    2. Behavioural: [Approval_callbacks.auto_approve] returns
       [Approve] (unchanged contract, for trusted system runs).
    3. Structural: every MASC source file that constructs an
       [Agent_sdk.Agent.t] via [Agent_sdk.Builder.build_safe] wires an approval
       callback (with_approval, or threads ~approval to a helper that
       does). Missing wiring → fail-open, the exact bug #7883.
    4. Structural: every MASC call site of
       [Keeper_turn_driver.run_named] / [Keeper_turn_driver.run_named*] passes
       [~approval:...].

    Detection is grep-based on source. False positives are acceptable
    (over-constrains wiring); false negatives regress the security
    gate and are not acceptable. *)
