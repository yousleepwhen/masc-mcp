(** Dashboard projection for cascade configuration and runtime health.

    Exposes the validated runtime cascade catalog alongside the live
    {!Cascade_health_tracker.global} snapshot so operators can see *why*
    a given provider is preferred without re-running a turn.

    Contracts:
    - {!config_json} reads the validated runtime snapshot from
      {!Cascade_catalog_runtime}; rejected hot reloads do not change the
      advertised profile set.
    - {!health_json} reads the global health tracker singleton.
    - Both return JSON suitable for dashboard consumption; callers are
      expected to forward via an HTTP handler without further massaging.

      events (defensive cap matching the default ring limit).  When
      the ring is empty the ratio defaults to [1.0] (treat idle as
      healthy).
    - [exhaustion_count] counts [Exhausted] events in the same sample.
    - [burn_rate] is [(1 - ordered_ratio) / 0.01], matching the
      Prometheus recording rule [masc:cascade_error_budget_burn].
    - [status] derives from [violations]: empty → ["ok"], burn_rate
      alone → ["warn"], any SLO hard-breach → ["violated"].
