(** Closed sum type for the [reason] label of
    [Prometheus.metric_persistence_read_drops]. See RFC-0044
    (`docs/rfc/RFC-0044-persistence-read-drop-typed.md`) for the full
    motivation.

    This module is introduced in PR-1 of the RFC-0044 migration and is
    intentionally inert: no caller in the tree references it yet.
    PR-2 changes [Core.Safe_ops.report_persistence_read_drop] to
    accept [t] instead of [string]; existing constants in
    [safe_ops.ml] become wire-compatible aliases. PR-3 (optional)
    introduces a [read_outcome] Result-style helper for opt-in
    caller migration.

    Adding a new variant here is, by construction, a compile
    obligation for every callsite once PR-2 lands.

type t =
  | List_dir_error (** Directory enumeration failed (permission / I/O / missing). *)
  | Entry_load_error (** A specific file under a directory failed to load. *)
  | Invalid_payload (** Payload was loaded but failed schema / shape validation. *)
  | Json_syntax_error (** Payload was loaded but JSON parsing raised. *)
  | Lock_contention
  (** Read aborted because a writer held the lock past the
          configured deadline. *)
  | Schema_version_mismatch
  (** Payload version is not understood by the current reader. *)
  | Decompression_error (** Compressed payload (gzip/zstd) failed to decompress. *)
  | Path_normalization_error
  (** Path containment / canonicalisation rejected the entry. *)
  | Stat_error (** [stat] / [lstat] failed before file open. *)
  | Concurrent_removal
  (** RFC-0134 PR-1. Entry was present at directory enumeration
          but absent at load time (TOCTOU race between [list_dir] and
          a concurrent writer that uses delete-then-replace). Not a
          data loss; the entry was concurrently retired by another
          writer. PR-3 of RFC-0134 routes this away from the
          data-integrity WARN/counter path. *)
  | Transient_fd_pressure
  (** RFC-0134 PR-1. Underlying [open()] failed with
          [ENFILE]/[EMFILE]. Not data loss; retry-eligible under
          RFC-0097 backpressure. PR-3 of RFC-0134 routes this to a
          DEBUG line (or a separate metric in PR-4), not the
          data-integrity counter. *)
  | Other of string
  (** Escape hatch for one-off surfaces. PR introducing a new
          [Other] payload must justify why the value cannot be
          promoted to a constructor. The lint
          [scripts/lint/no-free-string-read-drop-reason.sh] (PR-2)
          flags PRs that add [Other] for a value already used at
          another site. *)

(** Stable wire format. The strings produced here are byte-for-byte
    compatible with the existing string constants in
    [Core.Safe_ops] ([persistence_read_drop_reason_list_dir_error],
    [_entry_load_error], [_invalid_payload]) so swapping callers in
    PR-2 does not change the Prometheus label cardinality.
