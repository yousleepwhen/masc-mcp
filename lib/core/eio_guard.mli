(** Eio_guard — Dual-mode mutex guard for pre/post Eio runtime.

    Before {!enable} is called, all guard functions execute [f] directly
    (single-threaded, no locking needed). After {!enable}, they acquire
    the given [Eio.Mutex.t] before running [f].

    Call {!enable} once inside [Eio_main.run]. *)

(** Activate mutex guards. Call once after Eio runtime starts. *)
val enable : unit -> unit

(** Deactivate mutex guards. Useful in tests to reset state between
    [Eio_main.run] invocations so subsequent code outside the Eio
    runtime does not attempt Eio.Mutex operations. *)
val disable : unit -> unit

(** [true] after {!enable} has been called. *)
val is_ready : unit -> bool

(** Acquire read-write lock if Eio is ready, run [f] directly otherwise. *)
val with_mutex : Eio.Mutex.t -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** Acquire read-only lock if Eio is ready, run [f] directly otherwise. *)
val with_mutex_ro : Eio.Mutex.t -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** Run [f] in a system thread if Eio is ready, directly otherwise. *)
val run_in_systhread : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** Eio-aware replacement for [Fun.protect].

    When Eio is active, uses [Eio.Switch.run] + [Eio.Switch.on_release]
    so cleanup always runs and cleanup exceptions do not replace the body
    exception.  [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] always propagates correctly.

    Before {!enable}, falls back to [Fun.protect]. *)
val protect : finally:(unit -> unit) -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** Cooperatively yield to the Eio scheduler if the runtime is active.
    No-op before {!enable} or when called from a context where Eio cannot
    currently yield. *)
val yield_if_ready : unit -> unit

(** Check for cooperative cancellation if the Eio runtime is active.
    No-op before {!enable} or when called from non-Eio initialization paths. *)
val check_if_ready : unit -> unit

(** Named cooperative yield for scheduler-fair keeper/cascade boundaries.
    Equivalent to {!yield_if_ready}. *)
val fair_yield : unit -> unit

(** Default step interval for CPU-heavy loops.  P0 fair-yield contract: 1000. *)
val default_fair_yield_interval : int

(** Counter for periodic cooperative yields in CPU-heavy loops. Safe to share
    across fibers or domains. *)
type yield_meter

(** Create a meter that yields every [interval] steps.  Non-positive
    intervals are coerced to 1.  Default: {!default_fair_yield_interval}. *)
val create_yield_meter : ?interval:int -> unit -> yield_meter

(** Count one CPU work unit and call {!yield_if_ready} whenever the
    configured interval is reached. *)
val yield_step : yield_meter -> unit
