(** Exception-safe subprocess stdout capture.

    SSOT for the argv subprocess + drain + close pattern.  Extracted
    in the post-#8543 hardening (#8538) so every call site uses the same
    error-path close semantics.

    Why not [Fun.protect]?  Its finally-callback gets its exception wrapped
    in [Fun.Finally_raised], which masks the original exception that matters
    to callers.  Manual [try/with] lets [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] and other
    in-flight exceptions propagate unchanged.

    Why swallow close errors?  Per ocaml/ocaml#2447, [close_process_*] may
    raise [Failure "equal: abstract value"] when called on already-closed
    channels.  The close is best-effort; the primary contract is fd reclaim. *)
