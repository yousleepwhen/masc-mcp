(** Background shell task lifecycle for the Execute process surface.

    Maps agent_llm_a-code's [backgroundTaskId] / [BashOutput] / [KillShell]
    triad onto OCaml Unix primitives.

    Tick 6a (current): pull-based.  [read] drains whatever is pending
    on the child's pipes without blocking.  No long-lived fiber, no
    Eio switch — the MCP polling loop IS the drain cadence.  Child
    runs in its own session via {!Process_eio.spawn_detached};
    tree-kill via [Unix.kill (-pgid)] reaches descendants.

    Tick 7 (current partial): stdout/stderr are retained in a bounded
    in-memory line ring (default 5000 lines, override with
    [MASC_KEEPER_SHELL_RING_LINES]).  Slow readers get the retained
    suffix plus [bytes_dropped_*] evidence instead of unbounded heap
    growth.

    Tick 7 follow-up: introduce a daemon switch and push-based
    drainers so slow readers can't stall producers, plus
    append-only backing files under
    \`.masc/keeper/<name>/bg/<id>.{out,err}\` for persistence across
    reader restarts.  That tick will reintroduce a [val init :
    sw:Eio.Switch.t -> env:Eio_unix.Stdenv.base -> unit] hook
    separately from [spawn] so this signature stays stable. *)

(** Fork a long-lived shell task.  Runs until it exits, until
    [timeout_sec] elapses (SIGTERM -> grace -> SIGKILL), or until
    {!kill} is invoked.  The child starts in its own session; tree-kill
    addresses [-pgid].

    [timeout_sec = 0.0] disables the timeout — typical for keeper
    polling loops that expect to {!kill} explicitly.

    [base_path] when supplied enables PID-file persistence at
    \`<base_path>/.masc/keeper/<keeper>/bg/<task_id>.pid\`.  The file
    records \`pid\\npgid\\nstarted_at\\n\` so {!reap_orphans} can recover

    wall-clock elapsed time without consulting the child process or
    reading the PID file. *)

type lifetime_guard = { acquire : unit -> (unit -> unit) }

    and closes the final snapshot. *)

    [masc_bg_task_drain_unexpected_errors_total].

    Labels are closed-vocabulary and cardinality-bounded:
    - [fd_kind] is either ["stdout"] or ["stderr"] (call-site tagged).
    - [err_kind] is either ["unix_error"] (a [Unix.Unix_error] that
      is neither EAGAIN/EWOULDBLOCK nor EINTR — e.g. EBADF, EIO,
      ENOMEM) or ["other"] (any other exception).

    Cancellation ([Eio.Cancel.Cancelled]) is re-raised inside the
    drain loop and never reaches the observer. *)

val reap_orphans : base_path:string -> int

    SIGKILL any pgroup whose leader is no longer in the live task
    map, and delete the stale PID files. Returns the number of
    reaped orphans. *)
