(** File_lock_eio — cooperative per-key locking via [Eio.Mutex] + [flock].

    Two-layer locking for local filesystem paths:

    + {b Eio.Mutex} (cooperative) — prevents blocking the Eio fiber
      scheduler; serialises fibers within the process so most contention
      is resolved cooperatively.
    + {b Unix.lockf F_TLOCK} (non-blocking) — preserves cross-process
      safety; acquired after the Eio.Mutex. If another process holds
      the flock the caller yields and retries.

    Distributed backend paths (non-local keys in
    [room_utils_ops.ml]) are not affected. *)

(** {1 Tuning constants} *)

(** Cap on tracked per-path entries. When exceeded, entries with
    [Atomic.get active = 0] older than {!stale_lock_seconds} are
    pruned. *)
val max_lock_entries : int

(** Staleness threshold for inactive entries (seconds). *)
val stale_lock_seconds : float

(** {1 Low-level flock helpers}

    Used by non-Eio systhread contexts. Prefer {!with_lock} for
    ordinary callers. *)

(** Non-blocking [F_TLOCK] with retry. On success returns the open
    file descriptor holding the lock. On timeout closes the fd and
    raises [Failure]. [clock] is accepted but ignored in this variant
    (systhread-friendly). *)

(** Fiber-friendly wrapper around {!acquire_flock_retry}. Systhread
    is used for [openfile], [F_TLOCK], and retry sleeps (unless a
    clock is supplied, in which case [Eio.Time.sleep] yields to the
    Eio scheduler). *)

    per-[path] Eio.Mutex only. Use for in-memory backends that need
    single-process fiber serialisation but have no filesystem
    artifact to flock. *)
val with_mutex : string -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** [with_lock ?clock path f] runs [f] while holding both the
    cooperative Eio.Mutex and an OS-level flock on [path ^ ".lock"].
    The flock uses non-blocking F_TLOCK retries — max 200 attempts,
    ~2s total with default sleeps. *)

(** {1 Observability hook} *)

(** Fires after every {!acquire_flock_retry} / {!acquire_flock_retry_cooperative}
    attempt sequence completes — once per [acquire_*] invocation, with
    [outcome] = ["acquired"] or ["timeout"].

    [retries] is the number of failed [F_TLOCK] attempts before the
    final outcome (0 = succeeded on the first attempt).  [elapsed_s]
    is the wall-clock time spent in the retry loop excluding [openfile].

    Default no-op.  Wired at startup ([lib/coord.ml]) to a Prometheus
    counter ([masc_file_lock_retries_total]) and histogram
    ([masc_file_lock_acquire_seconds]) so contention storms surface in
    metrics.  [masc_process] cannot depend on [Prometheus] (sub-library
    boundary), so emission goes through this Atomic ref. *)

(** Observability hook fired on every CAS retry inside [atomic_update*].
    The lock table is shared by [prune_stale_entries] and [get_entry];
    high fiber contention (many fibers traversing the table for
    different paths) drives retry rate, the precise contention signal
    that was previously invisible. Wired at startup ([lib/coord.ml]) to
    a no-label Prometheus counter ([masc_file_lock_table_cas_retries]).
    [masc_process] cannot depend on [Prometheus] (sub-library
