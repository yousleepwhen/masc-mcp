(** Exception-safe subprocess stdout capture — SSOT for #8538. *)

type process_guard = { run : 'a. (unit -> 'a) -> 'a }
(** Process-wide guard wrapped around [Unix.open_process_*] helpers.
    Intended for resource accounting/admission control at the subprocess
    lifetime boundary. *)

val set_process_guard : process_guard -> unit
(** Install a process-wide guard. The default guard runs directly. *)

val reset_process_guard_for_testing : unit -> unit
(** Restore the default direct guard. Intended for focused tests. *)

val with_process_args_in :
  string -> string array -> (in_channel -> 'a) -> 'a * Unix.process_status
(** [with_process_args_in prog argv f] opens [prog] with exact argv control,
    passes the stdout channel to [f], and guarantees
    [Unix.close_process_in] runs on every exit path. Returns [f]'s result
    paired with the subprocess exit status.

    - If [f] raises, the channel is closed (best-effort) and the exception is
      re-raised.
    - [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] is re-raised after close so Eio's structured
      cancellation is preserved.
    - Close errors ([Unix.Unix_error], [Sys_error],
      [Failure "equal: abstract value"] per ocaml/ocaml#2447) are swallowed on
      the error path; the primary contract is fd reclaim.

    This helper intentionally avoids shell-string process APIs so callers
    cannot accidentally route command strings through a shell interpreter. *)

val drain_to_buffer : ?chunk:int -> in_channel -> Buffer.t
(** Read [ic] to EOF into a fresh buffer using [Buffer.add_channel].
    Default chunk size 4096.  Raises anything other than [End_of_file]
    (e.g. [Sys_error], [Unix.Unix_error]) to the caller — combine with
    [with_process_args_in] to close on such faults. *)

val drain_lines : in_channel -> string list
(** Read [ic] to EOF with [input_line], returning lines in source order. *)
