(** Generic 5-kind FD accountant (RFC-0101 + provider CLI extension).

    Extends {!Docker_spawn_throttle}'s 2-layer cap (semaphore + FD-pressure
    serialization) into a multi-class pool covering every spawn class
    that shares the host [kern.maxfiles] ceiling.

    Reference incident: 2026-05-16 18:08-18:15 ENFILE storm — 12+
    keepers concurrently retried cascade tiers, each retry spawned a
    fresh [docker run --rm], no backpressure existed at the host
    layer. PR #15727 closed docker; this module closes the other
    classes against the same ceiling.

    Layer A (per-kind): bounded concurrency via [Eio.Semaphore]. Each
    [kind] has its own slot count, env-overridable.

    Layer B (shared): when [Keeper_fd_pressure.active ()] is true, ALL
    kinds serialize against a shared global mutex. Engaged
    automatically; gives the cooldown room to drain.

    Callers wrap with [with_slot ~kind f]; [f] is invoked after a slot
    is acquired and FD-pressure (if active) is taken. *)

type kind =
  | Docker_spawn
      (** [docker run / exec / ...] subprocess. Migrates from
          {!Docker_spawn_throttle.with_slot} which now delegates here. *)
  | Provider_http
      (** Outbound LLM/tool HTTP connection
          ([Eio.Net.with_tcp_connect] + TLS state). One slot per
          in-flight call. *)
  | Provider_cli
      (** Outbound LLM provider subprocess attempt (Claude Code,
          Provider_f CLI, Codex CLI, Provider_c CLI). OAS owns the subprocess
          implementation; MASC accounts the call at the transport
          boundary so CLI fan-out shares FD-pressure backpressure. *)
  | Sandbox_exec
      (** Inner shell exec inside a sandbox container (popen pipes
          stdin/out/err + cgroup FD). Distinct from [Docker_spawn]
          which is the *container* spawn. *)
  | Log_writer
      (** High-throughput log writer (dashboard SSE log stream,
          telemetry JSONL append). Low-throughput [Log.warn] /
          [Log.error] paths are NOT slotted — they're FD-cost
          negligible. *)

val with_slot : kind:kind -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_slot ~kind f] acquires a [kind]-typed slot, runs [f ()],
    releases the slot, returns [f]'s result. When
    [Keeper_fd_pressure.active ()] is true at acquire time, [f] is
    additionally serialized against all in-flight callers across all
    kinds.

    Nested calls for the same [kind] on the same Eio fiber are reentrant:
    the inner call runs under the outer slot instead of consuming a second
    semaphore credit. This lets low-level process guards and explicit
    high-level wrappers coexist during migration.

    Exceptions from [f] propagate; the slot is always released
    (via [Eio.Switch.on_release]). *)

val acquire_lifetime_slot : kind:kind -> unit -> (unit -> unit)
(** [acquire_lifetime_slot ~kind ()] acquires a [kind]-typed slot and
    returns an idempotent release callback. This is for resources whose FD
    lifetime intentionally outlives the spawning call, such as background
    shell tasks. The release callback must be invoked exactly when the
    underlying FDs are closed; double invocation is ignored. *)

val effective_concurrency : kind:kind -> int
(** [effective_concurrency ~kind] returns the current cap.
    Returns [1] while [Keeper_fd_pressure.active ()] is true
    (degraded serialization), the kind's configured maximum
    otherwise. Observability only — not a synchronization primitive. *)

val configured_concurrency : kind:kind -> int
(** [configured_concurrency ~kind] returns the env-configured cap
    irrespective of current pressure state. *)

val install_dated_jsonl_log_writer_guard : unit -> unit
(** [install_dated_jsonl_log_writer_guard ()] installs the process-wide
    {!Dated_jsonl} append guard that accounts date-split JSONL writes as
    {!Log_writer} while {!Eio_guard} is ready. Before Eio startup, the guard
    runs the append directly so module-load and pure test paths stay safe. The
    module installs it at load time; the explicit function exists for tests and
    future bootstrap code that resets storage hooks. *)

val install_process_eio_sandbox_exec_guard : unit -> unit
(** [install_process_eio_sandbox_exec_guard ()] installs the process-wide
    {!Process_eio} foreground spawn guard that accounts [run_argv*] calls as
    {!Sandbox_exec} while {!Eio_guard} is ready. Before Eio startup, the guard
    runs directly so module-load and pure fallback paths stay safe. The module
    installs it at load time; the explicit function exists for tests and future
    bootstrap code that resets process hooks. *)

val install_with_process_sandbox_exec_guard : unit -> unit
(** [install_with_process_sandbox_exec_guard ()] installs the process-wide
    {!With_process} guard that accounts [Unix.open_process_*] helper calls as
    {!Sandbox_exec} while {!Eio_guard} is ready. The slot covers the whole
    subprocess lifetime: open, caller drain, and close. Before Eio startup, the
    guard runs directly so pure test/module paths stay safe. *)

val install_autonomy_exec_sandbox_exec_guard : unit -> unit
(** [install_autonomy_exec_sandbox_exec_guard ()] installs the process-wide
    {!Masc_mcp_cdal_runtime.Autonomy_exec} guard that accounts autonomy-loop
    child execution as {!Sandbox_exec} while {!Eio_guard} is ready. The slot
    covers the whole child lifetime, including waitpid, timeout handling, and
    stdout/stderr drain. *)

val install_bg_sandbox_exec_guard : unit -> unit
(** [install_bg_sandbox_exec_guard ()] installs the process-wide
    {!Bg_task} lifetime guard that accounts detached background shell tasks as
    {!Sandbox_exec} while {!Eio_guard} is ready. The slot is held until
    [Bg_task] observes task closure and closes stdout/stderr FDs. *)
