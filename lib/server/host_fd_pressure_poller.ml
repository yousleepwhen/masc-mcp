(* Host_fd_pressure_poller — see .mli for contract.

   RFC-0137 PR-2. Sunsets when RFC-0097 (sandbox container reuse)
   reaches steady state. See RFC-0137 §9.

   Design choices worth noting:
   - The poller does NOT dedup by (level, ts). The downstream
     [Keeper_fd_pressure.engage_external] uses [cas_monotonic_max]
     on [cooldown_until]; a stale [ts] yields a smaller [until_ts]
     and is rejected by the CAS. So even if this poller reads the
     same line twice, behaviour is correct.
   - Parse failures and missing files are no-ops, not warnings —
     during normal operation the file is *absent* most of the time. *)
