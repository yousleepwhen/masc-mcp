(* --- Operator proactive refresh ---
   Default (no-param) requests are served from a background-refreshed ref.
   Parameterized requests fall back to on-demand compute with SWR cache.

   Using Proactive_refresh gives circuit breaker + exponential backoff on
   repeated failures, matching the pattern used by execution and mission loops.

   Interval: 10s (was 120s). Even if compute takes ~8s, the ref is updated
   every ~18s worst-case, which is acceptable for dashboard SSE polling. *)

(* Late-bound broadcast refs — set by server_dashboard_http.ml after
   Sse module is in scope.  Same pattern as _broadcast_room_truth_ref. *)
