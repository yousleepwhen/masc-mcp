(** Option → JSON small builders + git_upstream_status record + 2
    small utility helpers for the dashboard runtime-info surface.

    Four 3-line option-to-Yojson coercers + the
    [git_upstream_status] record that captures git branch / upstream
    / ahead-behind state for a worktree, plus its empty default,
    plus 2 utility helpers shared by the rest of [Server_dashboard_
    http_runtime_info]:
      with swapped argument order.
    - [take n xs] — first n elements of a list (tolerant of short
      input).
    - [String_util.trim_to_option raw] — empty-after-trim string -> None.

    Pure builders + value records. Verbatim extract from
    [Server_dashboard_http_runtime_info]; the parent retains
    transparent record alias + 8 value aliases. *)
