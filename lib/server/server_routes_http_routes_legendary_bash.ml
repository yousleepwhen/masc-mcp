(** Legendary Bash dark-launch observer HTTP surface.

    Exposes the in-process [Legendary_counters] snapshot and the
    [Bg_task.list] per-keeper task roster as public-read JSON endpoints
    for dashboards and flip-decision tooling.  The counters themselves
    are incremented only while the matching observer env flag is
    enabled (see [LEGENDARY-BASH-RUNBOOK.md]); this endpoint is a
    zero-cost read.

      GET /api/v1/legendary_bash/shadow_counters
      GET /api/v1/legendary_bash/bg_tasks/<keeper>

    Response (200) for shadow_counters: JSON shape mirrors
    [Legendary_counters.snapshot] field-for-field, plus a [ratios]
    sibling object carrying the three derived flip-decision ratios
    ([disagree_ratio], [shadow_parse_coverage],
    [auto_bg_promotion_rate]) so consumers do not have to re-derive
    them client-side.  See [legendary_counters.mli] for the stable
    contract and the [Derived ratios (SSOT)] runbook section for the
    operator interpretation.

    Response (200) for bg_tasks: JSON of shape
      { "keeper": "<name>",
        "count": N,
        "tasks": [ "<task_id>", … ],
        "task_details": [
          { "task_id": "<id>",
            "started_at_unix": 1.73e9,
            "elapsed_ms": 1234 }, … ] }
    where [tasks] is the list returned by [Bg_task.list ~keeper] at
    the moment of the call; [task_details] attaches [started_at] and
    a server-computed [elapsed_ms] for observers that want wall-clock
    age without a second round-trip.  Both arrays share the same
    order, so [tasks.[i]] and [task_details.[i].task_id] agree.
    Unknown / quiet keepers legitimately return [count = 0,
    tasks = [], task_details = []] — the endpoint does not validate
    keeper existence, mirroring [shadow_counters]' "zero-cost read"
    posture. *)
