(** Server_mcp_transport_http_conn — SSE connection lifecycle
    management.

    Per-session SSE connection registry with rate-limit guard.
    All access to global registries is internally protected by
    atomic CAS loops; per-connection writes are protected by
    each {!sse_conn_info}'s mutex.

    Open'd by sibling modules (`server_mcp_transport_http`,
    `server_mcp_transport_http_agui`) — all top-level bindings
    here flow through into those namespaces. *)

(** {1 Connection state} *)

type sse_conn_info = {
  session_id : string;
  client_id : int;
  writer : Httpun.Body.Writer.t;
  mutex : Eio.Mutex.t;
  stop : bool ref;
  mutable closed : bool;
}
(** Concrete record because callers
    ({!Server_mcp_transport_http}, AG-UI bridge) construct it
    field-by-field for the SSE handler.  [client_id = -1]
    indicates an inline response (see {!make_inline_sse_conn}).

    [stop] is a [bool ref] (not [Atomic.t]) because all callers
    update it from a single fiber under [mutex]; the
    cross-fiber visibility is established via
    [Eio.Mutex.use_rw]. *)

(** {1 Connect-rate guard env knobs} *)

val sse_reconnect_min_interval_s : float
(** Cached at module-init from [MASC_SSE_RECONNECT_MIN_INTERVAL_S]
    (default [1.0]).  Minimum gap between two SSE connect
    attempts on the same session.  Setting to [0.0] or negative
    disables the per-session cooldown. *)

val sse_connect_window_s : float
(** Cached from [MASC_SSE_CONNECT_WINDOW_S] (default [60.0]).
    Sliding-window length for the burst-rate guard.  Setting to
    [0.0] or negative disables the window check. *)

val sse_connect_max_in_window : int
(** Cached from [MASC_SSE_CONNECT_MAX_IN_WINDOW] (default [10]).
    Max connect attempts per [sse_connect_window_s] before the
    guard returns [Error ("window_limit", _)]. *)

(** {1 Connection registry} *)

val register_sse_conn :
  session_id:string -> info:sse_conn_info -> unit
(** [register_sse_conn ~session_id ~info] adds [info] to the
    SSE registry under [session_id].  Replaces any prior entry
    for the same session — callers responsible for stopping
    the previous connection first via {!stop_sse_session}. *)

val close_sse_conn : sse_conn_info -> unit
(** [close_sse_conn info] flushes + closes the writer, sets
    [info.closed = true], [info.stop = true], and unregisters
    the SSE client.  Idempotent — safe to call multiple times.
    Errors during writer close log at {!Log.Misc.debug} but do
    not propagate. *)

val stop_sse_session : string -> unit
(** [stop_sse_session session_id] removes the registry entry
    AND clears the connect-rate guard state for [session_id].
    Calls {!close_sse_conn} on the removed connection. *)

val stop_sse_session_evict :
  string -> reason:Session_lifecycle_event.evict_reason -> unit
(** [stop_sse_session_evict session_id ~reason] is
    {!stop_sse_session} *plus* (a) a best-effort SSE
    [event: evicted] close frame written to the client before the
    writer closes, and (b) a typed
    {!Session_lifecycle_event.Evict}/{!Session_lifecycle_event.Close}
    pair published on the bus topic.

    Frame format: [event: evicted\\ndata: {"type":"evicted","reason":<reason>}\\n\\n]
    where [reason] is {!Session_lifecycle_event.evict_reason_to_string}.
    Operators and SDK clients key off the literal [event: evicted]
    line — RFC-0099 §3.

    Frame write is best-effort: a failure (writer already closed,
    network gone) logs at debug and continues to the close + publish
    path. Eviction does not abort on observability failure.

    PR-3 (RFC-0099) introduces this variant; cap-exceeded /
    backpressure / idle-timeout sites that previously called
    {!stop_sse_session} silently should migrate to this when the
    eviction is a *server-policy decision* (not a client
    disconnect). *)

val stop_sse_session_preserve_guard : string -> unit
(** [stop_sse_session_preserve_guard session_id] removes the
    registry entry but **preserves** the connect-rate guard
    state.  Used by intentional disconnect-then-reconnect flows
    (e.g. AG-UI bridge replay) so the rate guard does not
    re-arm and reject the re-connect. *)

val is_active_sse_session : string -> bool
val active_session_count : unit -> int

val reap_stale_guards : unit -> int
(** [reap_stale_guards ()] removes connect-guard entries whose
    deadline has passed AND whose session has no active
    connection.  Returns the number of reaped entries.  Called
    periodically by the cleanup loop to keep the guard map
    bounded. *)

val close_all_sse_connections : unit -> unit
(** [close_all_sse_connections ()] closes every SSE connection
    and clears both registries.  Logs the count at
    {!Log.Server.info} with prefix
    [["MASC MCP: Closed N SSE connections"]] — operator
    runbooks key off this prefix. *)

(** {1 SSE I/O} *)

val send_raw : sse_conn_info -> string -> bool
(** [send_raw info data] writes [data] to the SSE writer under
    the per-connection mutex, flushes, and touches the SSE
    timestamp via {!Sse.touch}.  Returns [false] when the
    connection is closed/stopped, the writer is closed, OR an
    exception occurred during write (in which case the
    connection is closed via {!close_sse_conn}).

    [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] re-raises verbatim — fiber
    cancellation does not silently mark the connection as
    failed.  Returns [true] on successful flush. *)

val make_inline_sse_conn :
  session_id:string -> Httpun.Body.Writer.t -> sse_conn_info
(** [make_inline_sse_conn ~session_id writer] constructs an
    [sse_conn_info] for an inline (non-registered) response.
    Sets [client_id = -1] sentinel so {!send_raw}'s
    [Sse.unregister_if_current] is a no-op for these
    connections.

    Used for one-shot SSE responses that bypass the per-session
    registry (e.g. SSE error envelopes that do not warrant a
    persistent slot). *)

(** {1 Connect-rate guard} *)

val check_sse_connect_guard :
  string -> (unit, Sse_reject_reason.t * float) result
(** [check_sse_connect_guard session_id] verifies that the
    session's SSE connect rate is within the configured limits
    AND records the new connect time on success.

    Returns:
    - [Ok ()] when the connect is allowed.
    - [Error (Sse_reject_reason.Session_cooldown, wait_s)] when
      {!sse_reconnect_min_interval_s} has not elapsed since the
      last connect on this session.
    - [Error (Sse_reject_reason.Window_limit, wait_s)] when the
      session has hit {!sse_connect_max_in_window} connects within
      {!sse_connect_window_s}.  [wait_s] is the time until the
      oldest connect-time entry leaves the window.

    The literal error tags ([["session_cooldown"]],
    [["window_limit"]]) are operator-visible — runbooks key
    off these to differentiate cooldown vs burst-limit
    rejections. *)
