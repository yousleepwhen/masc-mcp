(** Server_routes_http — top-level HTTP route facade.

    Re-exports the public surface of {!Server_routes_http_common},
    {!Server_routes_http_pages}, {!Server_routes_http_runtime}, and
    {!Server_routes_http_keeper_stream} so callers can [open
    Server_routes_http] and reach all handler helpers unqualified.
    The [include module type of] form auto-tracks the underlying
    modules; when narrower [.mli] files land for those sub-modules,
    this facade automatically picks up the tightened contract.

    {!make_routes} is the canonical builder used by the server entry
    point — it composes every [routes_http_routes_*] sub-router into a
    single Http_server_eio router. *)
