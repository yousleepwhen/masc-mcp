(** Server_routes_http_keeper_stream — keeper chat
    streaming HTTP route + payload parser.

    [Server_routes_http.ml] does
    [include Server_routes_http_keeper_stream] (as part
    of the route facade), and
    [server_routes_http_routes_dashboard] does
    [open Server_routes_http_keeper_stream] to reach
    {!parse_keeper_chat_stream_request} +
    {!handle_keeper_chat_stream} +
    {!keeper_chat_stream_error_json} unqualified.  The
    [module Keeper_stream = ...] aliases in 4 sister
    routing modules are leftover from an earlier
    refactor and currently have no call sites — they
    keep working through the type-passthrough but do not
    add to the surface here.

    External surface (3 entries + 1 record):
    - {b request record} ({!keeper_chat_stream_request})
      returned by the parser, consumed by the handler;
      the dashboard route reaches the [.name] field via
      record-pattern access.
    - {b parser} ({!parse_keeper_chat_stream_request})
      reached unqualified by the dashboard route + via
      dotted call from
      [test/test_gate_keeper_backend].
    - {b error envelope}
      ({!keeper_chat_stream_error_json}) reached
      unqualified by the dashboard route when surfacing
      parse / authorization failures.
    - {b SSE handler} ({!handle_keeper_chat_stream})
      drives the per-request SSE stream.

    Internal helpers stay private at this boundary
    (~10 internal lets — [contains_casefold],
    [get_origin] / [cors_headers] adapter helpers,
    [keeper_chat_stream_*] sub-renderers + per-event
    framing, connector-context and legacy model-argument
    payload guards). *)

    [sw] and the wall clock [clock].  Closes the writer
    on switch release; surfaces handler exceptions
    through the SSE stream rather than the HTTP envelope
    once the headers have flushed. *)
