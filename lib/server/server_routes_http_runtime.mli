(** Server_routes_http_runtime — runtime route handlers for the
    HTTP/1.1 listener (health / liveness / readiness / OPTIONS) +
    shared helpers used by sister route modules.

    Open'd by {!Server_routes_http_routes_frontend} and
    {!Server_routes_http_routes_activity} so all top-level
    bindings are part of the public surface.  The Http module
    alias stays private. *)

val is_dashboard_spa_deep_link : string -> bool
(** [is_dashboard_spa_deep_link path] returns [true] iff [path]
    is a dashboard SPA deep link that should be served by the
    SPA shell rather than rejected as 404.

    Three rules pinned at the contract seam:
    - starts with [/dashboard/]
    - NOT a [/dashboard/assets/] path (those have their own
      asset handler)
    - NOT [/dashboard/credits] (which has a dedicated handler)

    A future "let's add /dashboard/api/..." route reopens this
    classification — pinning so the SPA fallback does not
    accidentally swallow API routes. *)

(** {1 CORS} *)

val cors_preflight_headers : string -> (string * string) list
(** [cors_preflight_headers origin] returns the 4-header
    CORS preflight response for [OPTIONS] requests:
    [access-control-allow-origin] / [-allow-methods]
    ([GET, POST, DELETE, OPTIONS]) / [-allow-headers] /
    [-expose-headers] ([Mcp-Session-Id, Mcp-Protocol-Version]).
    Pinned method set + exposed headers are the operator-visible
    contract — runbook integrations key off these literals. *)

(** {1 JSON-RPC error envelope} *)

val json_rpc_error : int -> string -> string
(** [json_rpc_error code message] returns the canonical
    JSON-RPC 2.0 error envelope as a string:
    [{"jsonrpc":"2.0","error":{"code":<code>,"message":"<msg>"},"id":null}].
    Message is `String.escaped`-quoted; callers must not pre-
    escape. *)

val is_http_error_response : Yojson.Safe.t -> bool
(** [is_http_error_response json] returns [true] when [json] is
    a JSON-RPC 2.0 response with [id = null] AND [error.code]
    in [-32700] (Parse error) / [-32600] (Invalid Request).
    Mirrors the predicate in
    {!Server_mcp_transport_http_headers}; duplicated here
    because the route layer needs it before the transport
    headers module is reachable. *)

(** {1 Server uptime} *)

val server_start_time : float
(** Captured at module init via {!Unix.gettimeofday}.  The
    [/health] endpoint computes uptime as
    [now - server_start_time].  Pinned as a float because the
    health renderer formats with second precision (no micro). *)

val configured_http_port : unit -> int
val configured_http_host : unit -> string
(** Aliases over {!Env_config_core.masc_http_port_int} /
    {!Env_config_core.masc_host}.  Each call re-reads the env
    var, supporting tests that override mid-process. *)

val advertised_host_port :
  Httpun.Request.t -> string * int
(** [advertised_host_port request] returns the
    [(canonical_host, port)] pair the server should advertise
    in JSON projections.  Reads the [Host:] header (if present)
    via {!parse_host_port}, then routes the host through
    {!Transport_read_model.normalize_advertised_host} (loopback
    aliases collapse to the configured default).  Falls back to
    [(configured_http_host (), configured_http_port ())] when
    the header is absent. *)

(** {1 Discovery / status JSON} *)

val websocket_discovery_json : Httpun.Request.t -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [websocket_discovery_json request] returns the WebSocket
    discovery payload using {!advertised_host_port}.  Always
    sets [include_configured = true] so dashboards see the
    enabled / runtime-listening pair.  Used by [GET /ws.json]
    on both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 listeners. *)

val transport_json : Httpun.Request.t -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [transport_json request] returns the full transport status
    JSON (HTTP + WS + protocol set).  Sub-projection used by
    {!make_health_json}'s [transport] field. *)

val agent_card_json : Httpun.Request.t -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [agent_card_json request] returns the public well-known MASC server
    card served from [/.well-known/agent.json].  This route is public
    discovery metadata; mutable operations still require normal tool auth. *)

(** {1 Runtime subsystem helpers} *)

val cdal_health_json : unit -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [cdal_health_json ()] returns the CDAL health projection reused by
    runtime-info routes and the full health response. *)

(** {1 Health endpoints} *)

val health_path_diagnostics :
  unit -> Server_base_path_diagnostics.t
(** [health_path_diagnostics ()] resolves the base-path
    diagnostics for the [/health] response.  When the runtime
    state is initialised, reads from
    [state.room_config.base_path]; otherwise falls back to the
    default base path computed from env. *)

val make_health_json :
  ?listener:string -> ?section_timings_ref:(string * int) list ref -> Httpun.Request.t -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [make_health_json ?listener request] builds the full health diagnostics
    JSON body.  [listener] defaults to ["http/1.1"] and is overridden to
    ["h2"] by the H2 gateway.  This is the force-compute diagnostic builder
    used by tests and snapshot refreshes.  The public [/health] route uses
    {!make_health_response_json}; callers request cached full diagnostics with
    [/health?full=1].

    {2 paused_keepers contract}

    [paused_keepers.count] and [paused_keepers.names] are the union of
    registry-visible paused keepers and durable [.masc/keepers/*.json]
    metas with [paused = true].  The nested [running_*] and
    [durable_*] fields keep the two sources inspectable so a keeper
    that has been auto-paused and removed from the live keepalive set
    does not disappear from [/health].  [autoboot_enabled_*] and
    [details] distinguish auto-recoverable, operator-paused, and
    reconcile-gated durable pauses without auto-unpausing them.
    [missing_pause_root_cause] is true when a keeper is auto-recoverable
    but its persisted runtime has no typed [last_blocker].  [read_error_count]
    surfaces corrupt durable meta instead of silently reporting a clean zero.

    {2 keeper_fd_pressure and keeper_fleet_safety contract}

    [keeper_fd_pressure] exposes the effective process [nofile] soft
    limit, currently open FD count when available, the host kernel file-table
    snapshot when available, projected 24-Keeper budget, and the admission
    decision used by the FD guard.  This lets operators distinguish "shell
    says the host limit is high" from the actual runtime inherited by the
    server process, and distinguish process-local EMFILE from host-wide ENFILE.

    [fd_accountant] exposes the live resource accountant snapshot used by the
    shared spawn/HTTP/log backpressure layer: process FD open/limit readings,
    whether FD pressure is active, and each resource kind's in-flight,
    configured-concurrency, and effective-concurrency counts.

    [keeper_fleet_safety] compares configured autoboot-enabled keepers
    with the live healthy-running keeper fiber count while separately reporting
    [bootable_keeper_*] after durable pause filtering.  It distinguishes
    [running_keeper_fiber_count] / [healthy_running_keeper_fiber_count] from
    [failing_keeper_fiber_count] and [executable_keeper_fiber_count] because
    the FSM intentionally allows [Failing] keepers to finish or attempt turns.
    It reports [blocked] when autoboot-enabled keepers exist but no executable
    fiber remains, and [degraded] when executable fibers remain but healthy
    running capacity is zero, below the safety margin, or below
    [target_reaction_capacity_count].
    [paused_autoboot_enabled_keeper_count] makes the intended fleet size
    visible even when durable pauses suppress every bootable keeper.

    [keeper_reaction_ledger] summarizes recent durable stimulus -> reaction
    rows per keeper.  It reports [degraded] when a persisted stimulus has no
    later reaction/cursor/receipt row in the scanned window, making a stopped
    reaction chain visible without scraping keeper-local JSONL files.

    {2 lazy_task_boot_guard_fires_total contract (P2 silent-
    failure fix)}

    Surfaces {!Prometheus.metric_total} for
    [masc_lazy_task_boot_guard_fired_total].  Without this
    field, an operator hitting [/health] would see ["status":
    "ok"] while keepers had silently failed to start.  Pinning
    at the contract seam: a future "drop unused metric" PR
    must touch this. *)

val make_health_probe_json :
  ?listener:string -> Httpun.Request.t -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [make_health_probe_json ?listener request] builds the cheap default
    [/health] probe body.  It keeps liveness/readiness-facing fields such as
    [startup], [paths], [transport], [logs], and quick GC counters, but skips
    durable keeper scans, reaction-ledger JSONL reads, config TOML scans, and
    CDAL ledger inspection. *)

val make_health_response_json :
  ?listener:string -> Httpun.Request.t -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [make_health_response_json ?listener request] is the public [/health]
    renderer.  It returns {!make_health_probe_json} by default.  When the
    request query contains [full=1] / [full=true], it returns the latest cached
    full-health snapshot plus cheap request-local fields and marks the snapshot
    for refresh when it is missing or stale.  The HTTP handler must not
    synchronously run durable keeper scans; the Eio refresh loop started by
    {!start_full_health_snapshot_refresh_loop} performs those scans. *)

(** Starts the Eio background refresh loop for cached [/health?full=1]

(** [keeper_fleet_runtime_resolution_fields ()] returns the health/fleet
    safety subset projected into [/api/v1/dashboard/shell]'s
    [runtime_resolution].  It intentionally flattens
    [paused_keepers] to a count for the dashboard shell health chip while
    [/health] keeps the richer paused keeper object.  The
    [keeper_reaction_ledger] field keeps the same summary object as
    [/health] so the dashboard can render pending durable stimuli without a
    second endpoint.  [fd_accountant] is also projected here so the dashboard
    shell can show the same backpressure source as [/health] without scraping
    Prometheus. *)

val keeper_fleet_runtime_resolution_light_fields :
