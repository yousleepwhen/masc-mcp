(** Docker subprocess spawn throttle — bounds host FD pressure.

    Each [docker run/exec/...] call on the macOS host consumes
    host-side pipes/sockets and docker daemon FDs. Without an
    orchestrator-level cap on concurrent spawns, N keepers hitting
    a cascade-exhaustion storm can saturate the system FD ceiling
    (kern.maxfiles, default 491_520).

    Reference incident: 2026-05-16 18:08-18:15 ENFILE storm —
    12+ keepers concurrently retried cascade tiers, each retry
    spawned a fresh [docker run --rm], no backpressure existed at
    the host layer.

    Two layers:

    {ol
    {- Layer A — bounded concurrency via [Eio.Semaphore].
       Effective cap configurable via [MASC_DOCKER_SPAWN_CONCURRENCY]
       (default 8, range 1..64). Always on.}
    {- Layer B — FD-aware serialization. When [Keeper_fd_pressure.active ()]
       indicates the breaker is tripped, an additional global mutex
       funnels all in-flight spawns through a single thread, giving
       the cooldown room to drain. Engaged automatically.}}

    Callers wrap their spawn invocation with [with_slot]; the helper
    blocks until a slot is available. *)

val configured_max : unit -> int
(** Return the configured concurrency cap (env or default) for the current process.
    Used by tests to assert the invariant that the throttle never exceeds its ceiling. *)

val with_slot : (unit -> 'a) -> 'a
(** [with_slot f] acquires a docker-spawn slot, runs [f ()], releases
    the slot, and returns [f]'s result. If [Keeper_fd_pressure.active ()]
    is true at acquire time, [f] is also serialized against all other
    in-flight callers.

    Exceptions from [f] propagate; the slot is always released. *)
