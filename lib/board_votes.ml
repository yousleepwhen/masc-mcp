(** #9921 / #9903: fixture-pattern detection for persisted votes.

    Rationale: test fixture patterns should never appear in the
    production vote ledger. If they do, the ledger was corrupted at
    some earlier point (e.g. a pre-2026-04-18 test run that
    inherited the operator's MASC_BASE_PATH before the
    [(MASC_BASE_PATH "")] dune env-vars block landed in #8274).
    The detector surfaces the contamination at load time so
    operators see the problem immediately instead of the silent-
    persist failure mode that caused #9903.

    Pattern set is deliberately narrow and is applied only to the
    voter segment of the persisted target. Known production patterns
    are [keeper-*], [<name>-keeper-agent], bare agent IDs — none of
    which collide with the fixture patterns below.

    Env var: [MASC_BOARD_VOTE_QUARANTINE=1] promotes detection from
    warn-and-load to skip-fixture-rows. Defaults to warn-only to
    avoid surprising live operators.

    RFC-0089 §4-3 G2: voter classification is now typed via
    {!voter_kind}.  The boundary parser {!classify_voter_target}
    extracts the voter segment from the persisted target key and
    derives the variant once; downstream call sites pattern-match
    instead of re-running [String.starts_with]. *)

(** Get karma for all agents (cached).

    Cache check / rebuild / write are all performed inside one
    [with_lock] block — same pattern as [Board_core.list_posts] for
    [sorted_posts_cache].  Previously the read at [store.karma_cache]
    and the write to it lived outside [with_lock] while
    [Board_core.invalidate_*_caches] (callers always hold the lock)
    cleared the field under lock — so two fibers could both observe
    [None] and both rebuild, and an invalidation occurring between an
    unlocked read of a stale [Some _] and a downstream consumer was
    silently lost.  Hashtbl iteration / fold / List.sort are pure CPU
    with no fiber yields, so holding the Eio mutex during the rebuild
    is safe. *)
