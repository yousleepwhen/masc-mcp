(** Durable atomic write + crash-recovery orphan sweep.

    Owns the durability boundary that protects against partial
    writes, torn renames, and SIGKILL-during-write data loss. The
    contract is [tmp → fsync(tmp) → rename → fsync(parent dir)],
    so a crash between rename and the kernel's dirty-page flush
    cannot leave the target truncated or zero-length. Observed on
    [backlog.json] after an abrupt shutdown on 2026-04-18.

    Crash recovery is provided by [cleanup_atomic_orphans], a
    boot-time sweep for [.atomic_*.tmp] files left behind when the
    owning process was SIGKILL'd or [Filename.temp_file] itself
    raised ENFILE/EMFILE before the with-handler could register.

    The [save_file] and [mkdir_p_unix] primitives are injected so
    this module stays free of [Fs_compat]'s Eio bridge — same
    cycle-free placement pattern as [Mkdir_memo] and [Fd_cache]. *)

(** [save_file_atomic ~save_file path content] writes [content] to
    a temp file in [path]'s directory, fsyncs the tmp, renames it
    over [path], and best-effort fsyncs the parent directory.

    Returns [Ok ()] on success or [Error msg] when the write or
    rename fails (the tmp is cleaned up). Re-raises
    [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] after cleaning up the tmp — cancellation
    must not be swallowed (RFC-0143). *)

(** [true] iff [name] matches the [.atomic_*.tmp] shape produced
    by {!save_file_atomic}. Exposed so a periodic sweep can match
    the same filename pattern without re-deriving the prefix and
    suffix — #10205 finding 2. *)

(** #10130: boot-time sweep for [.atomic_*.tmp] orphans.

    Scans [base_path] and its immediate subdirectories (skipping
    [recovered_subdir] and anything that isn't a directory).
    - Zero-byte orphans are deleted (they lost the rename race
      but never held data).
    - Non-zero orphans are MOVED to
      [<base_path>/<recovered_subdir>/<original-name>.<ts-ms>]
      so operators can forensically inspect data-loss events
      instead of having them silently cleaned up.

    Returns [(deleted, preserved)]:
    - [deleted]: zero-byte orphans removed.
    - [preserved]: non-zero orphans moved to [recovered_subdir]. *)
