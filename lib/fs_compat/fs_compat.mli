(** #9921: raised by mutating [Fs_compat] entry points
    ([append_file], [save_file], [mkdir_p]) when the target path falls
    under [HOME] and the process is a test executable. Defense in depth
    behind [Env_config_core.base_path_prod_guard]. Bypass with
    [MASC_TEST_ALLOW_HOME_BASE_PATH=1]. *)

(** [true] iff [name] matches the [.atomic_*.tmp] pattern produced

    {!save_file_atomic}.  Exposed for tests and for a potential

(** #10130: boot-time sweep for [.atomic_*.tmp] orphans left
    behind when [save_file_atomic]'s with-handler never ran (the
    owning process was SIGKILL'd, or [Filename.temp_file] itself
    raised ENFILE/EMFILE before the cleanup was registered).

    Scans [base_path] and its immediate subdirectories (skipping
    [recovered_subdir] and anything that isn't a directory).
    - Zero-byte orphans are deleted.
    - Non-zero orphans are moved to
      [<base_path>/<recovered_subdir>/<original-name>.<ts-ms>]
      so operators can forensically inspect data-loss events
      instead of having them silently cleaned up.

    Returns [(deleted, preserved)]:
    - [deleted]: zero-byte orphans removed.
    - [preserved]: non-zero orphans moved to [recovered_subdir]. *)

    propagate as [Sys_error] (Eio.Io is normalized internally, matching

    rather than substring matching on the libc message. *)

    Use on hot append paths (jsonl writers, ledger appends) where the
    same dir is touched many times per second. RFC-0162 §3.1.

    The cache caches only the *fact* of dir existence; no fd is held.
    External processes that delete the dir after first call will see
    silent skip — acceptable for [.masc/] (self-owned). *)

    Logs each malformed line with the provided source label. Use when the caller needs
    to surface degraded state (e.g. dashboard malformed_lines field). *)
val load_jsonl_diagnostics : string -> Yojson.Safe.t list * int

(** Parse pre-read string lines as JSONL, returning parsed values and
    malformed count.  [source] is used in log messages.
    Use when lines come from tail-readers or non-file sources. *)
val parse_jsonl_lines : source:string -> string list -> Yojson.Safe.t list * int

(** Stream JSONL line-by-line via [Eio.Buf_read.lines] when the global
    fs is registered, falling back to a raw-line iterator over the
    Stdlib channel otherwise (both branches share the same [line_no]
    counting).  [line_no] is the 1-based index of {b non-blank}
    JSONL rows — blank lines are skipped, malformed lines emit a
    stderr warning and are skipped but {i still consume} the index
    so the counter tracks the printed JSONL row number rather than
    the count of successfully parsed values.  Use when the file may
    be too large to materialize as a list, e.g. audit/metrics JSONL
    on HTTP hot paths.

    Returns [init] when [path] is missing (consistent with
    {!load_jsonl}); raises [Sys_error] on read failures of an
    existing file. *)

(** Append JSON value as line to JSONL file.

    Backed by a process-local per-path fd cache (RFC-0162 §3.4).
    Each path keeps one cached [out_channel] reused across appends;
    cross-domain serialization is provided by the same per-path
    mutex registry as [append_file_unix], preserving RFC-0108 §3.2's
    Record-interleave-0 guarantee. The cache is bounded by
    [fd_cache_max=32] with LRU eviction; [close_all_cached_writers]
    is registered at [at_exit]. *)
val append_jsonl : string -> Yojson.Safe.t -> unit

(** Flush and close every cached [out_channel] held by
    [append_jsonl]. Safe to call concurrently with active appends;
    a subsequent [append_jsonl] re-opens fresh. Intended for
    shutdown sequencing and rare administrative refresh.
