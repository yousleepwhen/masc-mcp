(** Governance_pipeline — Unified risk-based approval gate for tool dispatch.

    Classifies tool calls by risk level and enforces governance policy
    (development/production/enterprise/paranoid) as a Tool_dispatch pre_hook.
    Denied or confirm-required calls are short-circuited before the handler runs.

    Integration: call {!install} once at server startup.

val confirm_threshold : string -> risk_level option

val keeper_confirm_threshold : string -> risk_level option
(** Keeper-specific confirmation threshold.
    Keepers are more autonomous than front-door tool dispatch, so production
    keepers confirm from High upward while the generic production surface
    confirms only Critical. *)

    - tool metadata overrides (readonly/destructive)
    - payload-sensitive destructive semantics for selected mutation fields

    - keeper mutation floor: keeper file/PR mutations are elevated to at least High

val install : config:Coord.config -> governance_level:string -> unit
(** Register the governance pipeline as a Tool_dispatch pre_hook.
    Reads governance level from the [governance_level] argument.

(** Build an OAS approval callback with genuine HITL fiber suspension.

    Pre-computes trifecta status from the keeper's active shard tool set.
    When trifecta is active, state-modifying tools get risk escalation.

    When a tool exceeds the governance threshold, the agent fiber
    suspends via [Keeper_approval_queue.submit_and_await]. An operator
    resolves the approval via the command plane API, resuming the fiber.

    Tools below the threshold are auto-approved.
