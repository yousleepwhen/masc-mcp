    omissions.  Paired with a once-per-fingerprint WARN log so logs
    carry structural facts and Prometheus carries frequency.

    RFC-0058 §2.4 / Phase 5.4: renamed from
    `masc_cli_tool_a_mcp_tool_omission_total` to keep provider identity
    out of the metric name; `provider` is now a label. *)

    bump only [metric_keeper_registry_update_dropped]. Labeled by [name]. *)

(** PR-J: number of times the per-turn OAS event-bus drain helper ran,
    labelled by call-site so operators can attribute drain pressure
    (e.g. background poller vs. unsubscribe vs. retry path).
    Labels: [site, outcome]. [outcome] is [drained] (events were
    pulled) or [empty] (subscriber returned no pending events). *)

(** Total keeper transitions to [Dead] phase after restart-budget exhaustion.
    Labeled by [keeper] and [reason]. Operators should alert on any rate >0:
    by construction Dead means the supervisor gave up and no further
    restart will be attempted. *)

(** Total keepers auto-resumed by the self-healing circuit breaker in
    [Keeper_supervisor.sweep_and_recover] after the per-keeper back-off
    timer elapsed.  Labeled by [keeper].  A positive rate indicates the
    system is self-healing from transient provider outages without operator
    intervention.  A sustained zero rate while [auto_resume_after_sec] is
    set in meta files indicates a sweep or meta-write regression. *)

(** Total keepers whose auto-resume was blocked in
    [Keeper_supervisor.sweep_and_recover] because the cascade health probe
    reported unhealthy (failure ratio >= threshold).  Labeled by [keeper]
    and [cascade].  A positive rate means the health gate is protecting
    the fleet from resuming into a still-failing cascade. *)

(** RFC-0020 Rule 2 evidence — incremented every time
    [run_smart_heartbeat_gate] overrides a [Skip_busy] / [Skip_idle]
    decision because the Event Layer queue
    ([Keeper_registry_event_queue.snapshot]) was non-empty. A zero
    rate against ongoing keeper activity means either the queue
    write path (PR-C1 [wakeup_keeper ?stimulus]) is not firing or
    the smart heartbeat is already returning [Emit] on its own —
    either way operators can distinguish. Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** Positive signal for the #12271 Skip_idle + Woken fix path. Increments
    each time [run_smart_heartbeat_gate] observes an external [wakeup_keeper]
    cut a Skip_idle backoff sleep short and the cycle was resumed
    ([cycle_continues_after_wake] -> [true]). Operator-meaningful pair with
    [masc_keeper_stale_termination_by_class_total] (class=idle_turn): a
    healthy fleet should show non-zero rates here proportional to inbound
    board signals, with the idle_turn kill rate trending toward zero. A
    zero rate after operator-visible signals suggests either the wakeup
    never reached the atomic, or a regression silently re-introduced
    MissedWakeup (KeeperHeartbeat.tla bug action).
    Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** Total stimuli consumed at turn entry, classified by [stimulus_class].
    Labels: [keeper], [class]
    (board_signal|bootstrap|alive_but_stuck_recovery|unsupported).
    Pairs with [masc_keeper_unsupported_stimulus_total] for unsupported-only
    drill-down with payload prefix. *)

    did not match any known stimulus class. Each increment represents a
    wake -> no_signal gap per #12684. Labels: [keeper]. *)

    checks and a recovery is launched. Labels: [keeper]. *)

    [keeper, outcome]. Outcome is one of:
    - [started]: keeper re-registered and fiber launched successfully
    - [not_running]: keeper re-registered but not in Running state after launch
    - [meta_missing]: no keeper meta file found — recovery skipped
    - [meta_read_failed]: meta read I/O error — recovery skipped
    - [meta_write_failed]: meta write to clear [paused] failed *)

(** PR-M (Leak 9): consecutive [provider_timeout] cycle FAILED strikes.
    Labeled by [keeper] and [outcome]:
    - [outcome=warn]: strike below [provider_timeout_strike_limit];
      cycle continues, supervisor not yet involved.
    - [outcome=promote]: strike at or above limit; [Keeper_fiber_crash]
      raised so [Keeper_supervisor.sweep_and_recover] respawns the
      fiber with a fresh context budget. Counter reset on any
      successful turn. *)
