(** Cascade health provider serializers.

    Pure conversions between [Cascade_health_tracker.provider_info]
    snapshots and dashboard JSON.  No I/O.  The aggregator-driven
    [health_json] surface lives in {!Dashboard_cascade_health_json}. *)

module Health = Cascade_health_tracker

(** Classify a provider's operational state for dashboard rendering.

    - [cooldown]: tracker opened a cooldown window.
    - [active]: events arrived in the current window and the tracker is
      not cooled down.
    - [configured]: declared in [cascade.toml] but has not produced
      tracker events in the current window (either untouched since
      startup, or expired from the window). The UI uses this to tell
      "declared-but-never-called" apart from the normal healthy case.

    A future [disabled] state (e.g. missing API key, registry drop)
    would live here too, but currently we have no per-provider health
    tracker entry for that condition. *)

    cascade-declared provider that has not been observed by the tracker
    in the current window.  [success_rate = 1.0] mirrors
    [Cascade_health_tracker]'s "unknown = optimistic" convention. *)

(** [provider_entry_to_json ~declared info] serialises a provider_info
    together with two derived fields:

    - [declared : bool]  — [true] iff any [cascade.toml] profile lists a
      model whose scheme prefix matches [info.provider_key].  Lets the
      UI distinguish "still referenced in config" from "left over in the
      tracker after a config change".
    - [status : string] — see {!provider_status}.

    Existing callers (tests, UI) read the previous 7 behavioural fields
    unchanged; the two new keys are strictly additive. *)
