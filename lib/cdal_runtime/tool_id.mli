(** Typed tool identifier for the CDAL runtime (RFC-0005 Phase 1 §3.1
    follow-up).

    Each constructor names a tool the CDAL runtime can recognise without
    a string lookup. [Mode_enforcer.default_tool_entries] used to seed
    classifications for these names but was emptied by RFC-OAS-012 — the
    Variant is kept because future register-side APIs may take
    [Tool_id.t] for compile-time exhaustiveness, and because a closed
    Variant remains the cheapest way to ensure the registry never silently
    diverges from a known catalogue.

    Public APIs of [Mode_enforcer] (e.g. [classify_tool],
    [register_tool_class]) remain string-typed because plugin tools
    register at runtime by name. The variant only types the
    *compile-time-known* default table.
