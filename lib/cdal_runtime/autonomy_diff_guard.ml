(* Normalize a command-ish string for matching:
   - strip shell-style line comments (# to end of line) per line
   - drop quote / backslash characters that don't change semantics for the
     coarse substrings we care about
   - collapse runs of ASCII whitespace to single spaces
   - lowercase ASCII

   This is intentionally cheap; it is a bypass-resistance layer, not a full
   shell parser. The original line is still passed through to the issue
   record so reviewers can see the verbatim source. *)
