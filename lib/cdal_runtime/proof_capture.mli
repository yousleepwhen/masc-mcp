(** Transparent proof capture middleware for CDAL.

    Part of the Contract-Driven Agent Loop (CDAL) PoC-1.

    Creates hooks that observe agent lifecycle events and accumulate
    proof data. Agent code is completely unaware of proof capture.
    Call [finalize] after agent run to write manifest and return proof.
