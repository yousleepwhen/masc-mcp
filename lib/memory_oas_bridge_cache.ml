(* Cache-aware episode loader.

   Previously held [episode_cache_mu] across
   [Institution_eio.load_recent_episodes_jsonl] on every cache miss,
   meaning all concurrent [persisted_episode_ids]
   / [cached_recent_episodes] callers serialised on a single JSONL
   read of up to [episode_cache_limit = 500] records. Same drift
   class as the [Prompt_registry] / [Discovery_cache] siblings fixed
   in PRs #6663 / #6668 - an [_unlocked] helper was called from
   inside the caller's [with_mutex], re-introducing the
   I/O-under-lock anti-pattern.

   Split into:
   1. Stamp check under the mutex (pure [Hashtbl.find_opt] +
      [Unix.stat]).
   2. Hot path returns the cached record if the stamp still matches.
   3. On miss, release the lock, build the cache from disk outside
      the lock, install under a fresh short mutex section.

   Concurrent misses may both run the JSONL read; that is wasteful
   but correct (the last writer wins on [Hashtbl.replace]). In
   practice the stamp check short-circuits the vast majority of
   calls. *)

(* Record an episode that was just appended to the JSONL file.

   Previously called [load_all_episodes_cached_unlocked] while
   holding [episode_cache_mu], which meant a cache-miss during
   flush would block on the same under-mutex JSONL read the main
   fix addresses above. Instead, look the cache up in place: if
   it exists, mutate in place (fast path - no I/O); if it's
   missing, skip - the next [load_all_episodes_cached] call will
   populate a fresh cache from disk including the newly-appended
   episode.

   The [stamp] update keeps the cache in sync with the file's new
   mtime so subsequent loaders do not trigger a reload purely
   because [note_episode_flush] just wrote to the file. *)
