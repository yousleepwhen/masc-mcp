(** MASC Hebbian Learning - Collaboration Pattern Learning (Eio Native)

    "Agents that fire together, wire together"

    Pure synchronous operations (direct-style).
    Compatible with Eio direct-style concurrency.

    Tracks successful collaboration patterns:
    - Strengthen connections on successful tasks
    - Weaken connections on failures
    - Consolidate (decay) old connections
