(** Tool_shard_types — facade re-exporting the split sub-modules.

    Stage 11 (docs/audit/2026-05-18-godfile-decomposition-build-plan.html):
    the original 1750 LOC file was split into cohesive sub-modules so that
    each schema family and the hand-mirrored enum strings can evolve in
    isolation while [Tool_shard_types]'s public API stays byte-identical
    for [Tool_shard.include Tool_shard_types]. *)
