(* RFC-0128 §4.1 — canonical URL slug derivation.

   Accepted shapes:
     - https://github.com/owner/repo
     - https://github.com/owner/repo.git
     - http://host/owner/repo
     - ssh://git@host/owner/repo.git
     - git@host:owner/repo.git
     - git@host:owner/repo

   Output: lowercase host + path joined by '_'. Returns None if input is
   empty, lacks host or path, or any segment contains characters outside
   [a-z0-9._-]. The slug is deterministic so the same upstream resolves
   to the same bucket regardless of which transport the remote was
   registered with. *)
