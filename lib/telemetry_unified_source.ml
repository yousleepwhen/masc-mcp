(** Telemetry unified source variant + total string bijection.

    SSOT for the 9-variant [Telemetry_unified.source] enum that names
    each durable telemetry stream (keeper_metric, agent_event,
    tool_call_io, trajectory_tool_call, tool_usage, oas_event,
    execution_receipt, goal_event, tool_metric).

    Pure variant + total bijection (modulo unknown-string → None on
    parse). Verbatim extract from the head of [Telemetry_unified];
    the parent retains a transparent variant alias so existing
    exhaustive matches at ~20 qualified call sites continue to
    type-check unchanged. *)

  | Trajectory_tool_call  (** Keeper trajectory-backed tool call rows *)
  | Tool_usage     (** System_internal surface tool invocations *)
  | Oas_event      (** Durable OAS native/custom event bus relays *)
