(** Comment rate limiting: per-author sliding-window tracker.

    Extracted from [board_core.ml] (lines 60-90) as part of the godfile
    decomp campaign. Owns a single module-level [Hashtbl] keyed by
    author name, with each entry holding a mutable list of timestamps.

    The rate window and per-window limit come from [Limits]
    ([comment_rate_window_sec] / [comment_rate_limit]); when the limit
    is non-positive, [check] returns [None] (rate limiting disabled).

    Thread-safety: callers must hold [board_core] [with_lock store]
    before invoking [check] / [record]. The module itself uses
    [Stdlib.Hashtbl] (no internal locking). *)

    match Hashtbl.find_opt comment_timestamps author with
    | None -> None
    | Some ts_ref ->
      let recent = List.filter (fun t -> now -. t < window) !ts_ref in
      ts_ref := recent;
      if List.length recent >= limit
      then (
        (* [limit > 0] (line 23) plus [List.length recent >= limit]
           guarantee the sorted list is non-empty; the [[]] branch is
           unreachable but typed exhaustively so the compiler enforces
           the invariant. *)

(** [sweep_stale ~now ~window] drops timestamps older than [window]
