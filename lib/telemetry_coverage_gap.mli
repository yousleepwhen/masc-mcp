(** Telemetry_coverage_gap — durable record of telemetry write-path
    failures.

    A "coverage gap" is a moment when one telemetry lane wrote
    successfully but another did not, leaving the dashboards
    showing stale data even though the producer is healthy.
    {!record} stamps both a Prometheus counter
    ([metric_telemetry_coverage_gap]) and a JSONL row under
    [<masc_root>/telemetry-coverage-gaps/] so unified telemetry
    can surface the gap on its next read.

    Internal helpers (the [store_dir] path joiner and the
    [string_opt_json] None-vs-empty serialiser) are hidden —
    callers consume only the recorder and the reader. *)

(** Append one [masc.telemetry_coverage_gap.v1] JSONL row to the
    durable store and bump
    [Prometheus.metric_telemetry_coverage_gap] with the
    ([source] / [producer] / [dashboard_surface] / [stale_reason])
    label tuple.

    [keeper_name] / [trace_id] / [error] are optional contextual
    fields — when omitted (or empty after trim) the JSON value
    is rendered as [`Null] rather than the empty string so
    downstream consumers can distinguish "missing" from
    "deliberately blank".

    [exn] is the RFC-0154 typed path: when present, [record] calls
    [System_error_class.classify_exn] internally to derive
    [error_class] (errno match → typed variant) and uses
    [Printexc.to_string exn] as the raw [error] string unless an
    explicit [error] argument is also supplied. When [exn] is absent
    but [error] is present, [classify_string] runs over [error] for
    the typed tag. When both are absent, [error_class] is [`Null].

    The wire row carries an [error_class] field alongside the existing
    [error] field — readers should prefer the typed tag and fall back
    to substring matching on [error] (RFC-0154 §4 backward compat
    window). *)

    [Dated_jsonl.read_recent]. Returns the empty list when
    [n <= 0] or when the store directory does not yet exist
    (no rows have been recorded for this [masc_root]). *)
