(** Admission_queue — MASC-layer admission observability for inference calls.

    Current runtime mode is passthrough: provider-level throttling and retry
    ownership live in the OAS cascade layer. This module still records
    MASC-visible inflight state, host-resource rejection, and the configured
    capacity hint used by dashboards.

    The waiter metadata and priority helpers are retained as observability
    scaffolding for the RFC-0026 cascade-layer admission router. They are not
    an active MASC-side scheduler in the current call path.
