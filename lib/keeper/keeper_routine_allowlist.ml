(* ── Action extraction ───────────────────────────────────── *)

(** Extract a routine action from a tool input JSON.

    Tools in the allowlist use either an [op] key (structured search /
    Execute family) or an [action] key (masc_transition family); we
    accept both so a single rule type can describe both surfaces.
    Prefer [op] when it is present because shell execution semantics
    come from [op], and an unrelated [action] key must not be able to
      mask a dangerous command op. *)

(* ── Static rule table ────────────────────────────────────── *)

(** Tool-specific allowlist rule. Each rule encodes:
    - which tool name it applies to;
    - the maximum risk level at which it auto-approves;
    - an optional set of routine action/op strings. For shell-like tools
      [op] is authoritative; otherwise [action] is used. [None] means
      "any input is allowed up to [max_risk]" (no action discrimination
      needed);
    - a short human-readable label for audit logs. *)

(** Allowlist rules. KEEP THIS LIST NARROW.

    Adding entries here changes governance policy. Do not allowlist:
    - destructive force_* actions (these are classified Critical via
      "force" pattern and stopped by [auto_approval_forbidden] anyway,
      but listing them here would be a defense-in-depth hole);
    - shell or git tools;
    - broad high/critical-risk tools. The path-aware sandbox worktree code
      write exception lives below, outside this static table.
