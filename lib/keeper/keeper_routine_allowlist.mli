(** Keeper_routine_allowlist — code-defined auto-approval rules for keeper
    autonomous task lifecycle.

    Background: in production/enterprise/paranoid governance, certain
    common keeper actions (e.g. masc_transition action=claim, action=done)
    can land on or above the confirmation threshold and stall keepers in
    [awaiting_approval] indefinitely. Operators are not always present to
    approve every routine claim/heartbeat/done.

    This module defines a narrow, code-only allowlist of (tool,
    routine action/op) pairs that are safe for autonomous keeper flow.
    The rules are checked by
    [Governance_pipeline.to_oas_approval_callback] before the soft
    destructive tool/op substring gate, but hard blockers still win, so:

    - Critical risk still gates
    - runtime_auto_approval_blocked (cascade_exhausted etc.) still gates
    - shell or git tool names still gate unless an exact routine rule
      matches the tool plus op/action
    - High-risk code write/edit tools auto-approve only when a keeper has a
      current task and the target resolves inside that keeper's sandbox
      repo worktree lane
    - force_* actions still gate (classified as Critical via "force"
      pattern in {!Governance_pipeline_risk.classify_name})

    The allowlist is intentionally narrow:
    - [masc_transition]: only claim, start, heartbeat, done, release.
      cancel and force_* are NOT allowlisted.
    - [keeper_board_post]: any post at risk Low or Medium.
    - [keeper_task_claim], [keeper_task_done],
      [keeper_task_submit_for_verification]: standard autonomous flow.
    - Structured search has no routine auto-approval rule.

    These rules are not persisted; they are part of the policy code surface
    and require code review to change. Operator-managed rules continue to
    flow through {!Keeper_approval_queue.find_matching_rule}.

    @since 2.270.0 *)

(** Returns [true] when the given tool call matches a routine
    allowlist rule. Caller is assumed to be a keeper agent (this is
    only ever invoked from the keeper OAS approval callback path).

    [risk_level] is the risk classification computed by
    {!Governance_pipeline.assess_risk}. [keeper_board_post] is
    rejected at [High]/[Critical].

    Returns [false] for any tool/action/op pair not on the allowlist;
    this preserves the human-loop for non-routine flows. *)
val matches :
  tool_name:string ->
  input:Yojson.Safe.t ->

  bool

(** A short label describing which rule matched. Returns [None] when
    no rule matches. Useful for audit logs and dashboard observability. *)
val rule_label :

  risk_level:Keeper_approval_queue.risk_level ->
  string option

(** Narrow High-risk exception for autonomous code edits.

    Returns a routine label only when all of these are true:
    - [tool_name] is a known code write/edit surface;
    - [risk_level] is at most [High];
    - [meta.current_task_id] is set;
    - the target path resolves through the keeper write-path resolver;
    - the resolved target is under [repos/.../.worktrees/...], not a root
      checkout, runtime state file, or arbitrary sandbox file.

    This is intentionally separate from the generic rule table because it is
    path- and keeper-state-aware. *)
