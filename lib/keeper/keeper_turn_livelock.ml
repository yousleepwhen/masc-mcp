(** Keeper_turn_livelock — observability surface for stuck-turn livelocks.

    #10121 reports 10 (keeper, turn) pairs retrying 4-12× over 4+ hours
    because the FSM has no max-attempts guard or stuck-turn detector.
    The root cause trigger is a [write_meta] CAS race (#9733) that
    silently drops the in-memory turn-counter increment, but the
    defense-in-depth gap is observability: nothing surfaces "this
    keeper has tried turn 91 twelve times" until an operator greps
    log lines.

    Per-keeper in-memory state tracks the most recent turn id seen and
    the attempt count for that id.  When the same id starts again we emit
    a re-attempt counter.  When the id moves strictly backwards we emit a
    regression counter (rare; indicative of the write_meta race).  When
    the id advances normally we reset the per-keeper bookkeeping.  The
    guarded entrypoint enforces a per-turn retry/age budget before the
    dispatcher marks the turn live.

    State is process-local: a server restart resets the counters,
    which is intentional — the issue's fleet-wide signal comes from
    in-process retry storms, not cross-restart divergence. *)

(* Eio.Mutex: keeper turn lifecycle is invoked from Eio fibers in a single

   "Resource deadlock avoided" the moment two fibers on the same OS thread
   contend (memory: feedback_eio-mutex-vs-stdlib). All callbacks below are
   pure Hashtbl ops with no yielding effects, so use_rw is a drop-in. *)
