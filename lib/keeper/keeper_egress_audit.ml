(** Boot-time audit for keeper egress policy file placement.

    Leak 11 (2026-04-27): keeper "executor" had its [egress.json] at the
    host-direct path [playground/<name>/egress.json] while the docker
    keeper code resolved [egress_policy_path] to
    [playground/docker/<name>/egress.json].  The file at the wrong
    location was never read; the lookup fail-closed for 24h+ and every
    URL command surfaced as [egress_blocked, allowed=[]].

    This module does no I/O writes — it inspects the file system and
    classifies each keeper's policy file state.  Callers (boot hook,
    CLI verification, tests) decide whether to log, fail, or repair.

    Status taxonomy ─

    [Ok_present] — expected path exists, no follow-up needed.

    [Missing_at_expected] — expected path is absent and there is no
    drifted copy elsewhere.  Operator should seed the file (egress
    policy is fail-closed without it).

    [Stale_orphan] — expected path is absent but a host-direct copy
    exists.  Indicates the same drift class that produced Leak 11:
    the file was seeded under the wrong sandbox_profile assumption.
    Operator should move (or copy + delete the orphan).

    Local keepers always treat [playground/<name>/] as the canonical
    location, so the [Stale_orphan] class only applies to Docker
    keepers. *)
