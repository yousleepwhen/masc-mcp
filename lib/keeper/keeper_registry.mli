(** Keeper_registry — Single source of truth for keeper state.

    Replaces scattered state across keeper_keepalive Hashtbl,
    keeper_supervisor Hashtbl, and file-based meta lookups.
    All keeper state queries and mutations go through this module.

    Thread-safety: all operations are non-yielding (in-memory map/ref
    ops only).  In single-domain Eio, non-yielding code runs atomically
    w.r.t. other fibers, so no mutex is needed. *)

(** Mark the beginning of an SDK turn within an existing keeper turn.

    The Agent SDK [run_loop] iterates N SDK turns inside a single MASC
    keeper-turn window. Each SDK turn fires [before_turn_params] which
    leads to [prepare_agent_setup] writing
    [Cascade_selecting]/[Decision_tool_policy_selected]/[Turn_prompting].
    Without this boundary signal, the second-and-later SDK turn writes
    transition from the previous SDK turn's terminal phase
    ([Turn_finalizing] after [Cascade_done]/[Cascade_exhausted]), which
    [validate_turn_phase_transition] rejects with
    [Turn_phase_transition_violation].

    This function resets the in-turn FSM fields ([turn_phase],
    [cascade_state], [decision_stage]) on the existing observation, the
    same way [mark_turn_started] bypasses the validator with a fresh
    install. [turn_id], [started_at], [selected_model], [measurement],
    [measurement_bind_count], and progress timestamp are preserved across
    SDK turns inside one keeper turn (they are keeper-turn-scoped, not
    SDK-turn-scoped).

    No-op when [current_turn_observation = None] (defensive: should not
    happen in normal flow because [mark_turn_started] runs first).

    See RFC-0045 (SDK turn boundary alignment with MASC keeper FSM). *)

(** Advance the live turn's projected decision stage. No-op if idle.
    Input type [decision_stage_active] excludes [Decision_undecided];

    unrepresentable at the call site (replaces prior runtime [invalid_arg]). *)

(** Advance the live turn's projected cascade state. No-op if idle.
    Sets [turn_phase] to [Turn_executing] for [Cascade_trying] and to

val set_turn_cascade_state :
  base_path:string -> string -> packed_cascade_state -> unit

(** Mark cascade exhaustion on the live turn.

    When provider selection fails before the tool-disclosure hook runs, the
    live cascade axis can still be [Cascade_idle]. This helper materializes the
    spec-valid pre-terminal path ([idle -> selecting -> trying -> exhausted])
    instead of allowing callers to jump directly to [Cascade_exhausted]. No-op
    when no turn is active. *)
val mark_turn_cascade_exhausted : base_path:string -> string -> unit

(** Mark cascade success on the live turn.

    When provider execution returns before the tool-disclosure hook advances the
    registry projection, the live cascade axis can still be [Cascade_idle]. This
    helper materializes the spec-valid pre-terminal path ([idle -> selecting ->
    trying -> done]) instead of allowing callers to jump directly to
    [Cascade_done]. No-op when no turn is active. *)
val mark_turn_cascade_done : base_path:string -> string -> unit

(** Mark that the live turn has entered a provider attempt.

    This materializes the registry-side projection that corresponds to
    [Keeper_turn_fsm.Streaming]: [Cascade_idle] advances through
    [Cascade_selecting] into [Cascade_trying], and [turn_phase] follows to
    [Turn_executing]. No-op when no turn is active or the cascade is already
    trying/terminal. *)

    Phase 4b + 5).  [validate_compaction_transition] is an exhaustive
    3×3 match raising the typed [Compaction_transition_violation] on a
    forbidden pair (RFC-0072 Phase 6 — no GADT/resolver indirection,
    the axis has 3 states and a single consumer).  Both bump
    [Prometheus.metric_fsm_guard_violation] via
