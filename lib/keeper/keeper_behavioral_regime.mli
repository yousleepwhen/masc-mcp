(** Keeper Behavioral Regime — pure projection (7th FSM axis MVP).

    Projects a keeper's {b observable signals} into a derived
    behavioral regime — distinct from the 6 mechanical FSM axes
    (KSM/KTC/KDP/KCL/KMC/KCB) which capture "where in the code".

    This axis answers the orthogonal question: "what mode is the
    keeper actually in?" (research basis: Provider_a persona vectors,
    Jason Wei CS25 V4 emergent-capability cliffs, Fowler circuit
    breaker.)

    Contract (mirrors [Keeper_composite_observer]):
    - Pure read. No mutation, no I/O, no event emission.
    - Does not read provider names, token counts, or context bytes —
      those belong to OAS (see [feedback_masc-oas-layer-boundary]).
    - Takes a {b minimal} input record {!input} rather than the full
      [Keeper_registry.registry_entry]. The wrapper in
      [Dashboard_behavioral_regime] handles projection from the
      registry entry; this keeps the deriver trivially testable and
      framework-free (Alexis King, "Parse don't validate").

    MVP scope: 3 regimes derived from turn-failure counter + restart
    history + per-tool failure aggregates. Phase 2 adds Ruminating /
    Avoiding / Saturated / Echoing once richer telemetry hooks exist.

    @since RFC-0003 Phase 3 — 7th axis. *)

(** Regime values are ordered by precedence (highest first). When
    multiple rules fire simultaneously, the highest-precedence one
    wins. Rationale: Jason Wei's "emergent capability cliff" framing
    — regime transition is discrete, not gradient-interpolated, so a
    single-value enum is closer to the phenomenon than a boolean
    vector of independent flags. *)
type regime =
  | Crashing
      (** Lifecycle instability — restart count elevated in a recent
          window. Highest precedence because a crashing keeper cannot
          meaningfully thrash. *)
  | Thrashing
      (** Repeated failure without recovery — turn failures or per-tool
          failure saturation. Analog of Fowler circuit-breaker pre-trip
          at the turn level rather than per-call. *)
  | Healthy
      (** None of the above. Default. *)
