    keeps small cascades (N<10) from tripping on the first transient pause;
    larger cascades retain the original 10% rule.

    The previous formula [ratio < 0.10] meant any cascade with N<10 had a
    de-facto zero tolerance (1/3 = 0.333 ≥ 0.10), so a single auto-paused
    keeper in a 3-member cascade became a permanent admission block in
    [keeper_supervisor.ml]'s auto-resume path. The floor restores the obvious
    invariant ("one keeper down out of N is recoverable") at every N. *)

(** Compute health per cascade from registry entries.

    A keeper is counted as "failed" only when its phase is a terminal
    unhealthy state (Dead, Zombie, or Crashed).  Past restarts
    (restart_count > 0) do NOT count — a restarted keeper that is now
    Running is healthy.  Prior to this fix, restart_count was used as
    the proxy, causing permanent cascade pollution after any single
    restart since restart_count is monotonic and never resets.

    Per-item health is updated via [record_item_result] after each
