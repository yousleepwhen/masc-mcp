(** Field-ownership merges for keeper_meta on CAS retry (#9769).

    A caller-wins retry re-reads the disk version on conflict and then
    writes the caller's payload wholesale, only bumping [meta_version]
    to [latest.meta_version]. When the retry loser is the turn-failure
    writer and the winner is the heartbeat fiber, the heartbeat's
    updates to [joined_room_ids] and [last_seen_seq_by_room] are
    clobbered — even though the turn path never touches those fields.
    This is false sharing on a single version counter.

    A correct three-way merge requires the caller to declare which
    fields it owns. This module provides named merge strategies; the
    identity function ([caller_wins]) preserves the historical
    behaviour for the call sites that still need it.

    Analogy: this is the Git three-way merge pattern expressed with
    explicit field ownership per writer, or a minimal CRDT with
    per-field LWW where the "W" is the declared owner. *)

type t = latest:Keeper_types.keeper_meta -> caller:Keeper_types.keeper_meta -> Keeper_types.keeper_meta

val caller_wins : t
(** Take every field from the caller except [meta_version], which
    follows the disk version. Use only when payload-wins is the intended
    CAS conflict policy. *)

val heartbeat_fields_from_disk : t
(** Take heartbeat-owned fields ([joined_room_ids],
    [last_seen_seq_by_room]) from [latest]; everything else from
    [caller]. Use this from turn-completion and turn-failure paths
    where the caller never touches heartbeat fields but concurrent
    heartbeat writes keep winning the CAS race. *)
