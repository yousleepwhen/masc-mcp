(** Keeper_checkpoint_store_failure_site — closed sum for [site] label on
    [metric_keeper_checkpoint_failures] when emitted from the
    checkpoint-store layer (5 sites in keeper_checkpoint_store.ml).

    NOTE: the underlying metric is shared with
    {!Keeper_checkpoint_failure_operation} but emits use the legacy [site]
    label key (kept verbatim to preserve Grafana dashboard queries
    that select on `site=...`).  A follow-up RFC could harmonise the
    label key to a single [operation] across both call sites once
    dashboards are migrated. *)
