(** Keeper_memory_recall_exn_class — closed sum for the [exception_class]
    label on the memory-bank history swallow counter.

    Bounds the Prometheus label cardinality of the swallowed-exception
    counter emitted from [Keeper_memory_recall.load_history_user_messages].

    The previous implementation (PR #15781) passed [Printexc.to_string exn]
    directly as the label value. That string carries exception-specific
    detail (byte offsets, file paths, payload fragments from
    [Yojson.Json_error]; per-syscall context from [Unix.Unix_error]; raw
    [Failure] messages) so each distinct exception instance created a new
    Prometheus time-series. Codex P1 flagged this as unbounded label
    cardinality / balloonable in-process metric memory.

    [classify] is a *constructor-level* pattern match on the OCaml [exn]
    type, not a substring scan on [Printexc.to_string] output, so adding
    a new mapping is type-checked, not text-heuristic. The full error
    string is still emitted to the log line; only the *label* is bounded.
