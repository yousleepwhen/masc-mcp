(** Turn-scoped factory for {!Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.t}.

    A single keeper turn may dispatch tool calls from different cwds,
    each implying a different [in_playground] state.  The factory
    centralizes the {!Keeper_sandbox_runner.effective_sandbox_profile}
    invariant, evaluates [in_playground] from the call-site [cwd] only for
    runtime workspace reuse, and memoizes one runtime per
    [(in_playground, network_mode)]
    so a Docker container is created at most once per compatible dispatch
    context within a turn.  The runtime can still execute from different cwd
    values via [Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.container_cwd_of_host].

    Background: pre-PR-3b, [keeper_tools_oas.make_tool_bundle] inspected
    [meta.sandbox_profile] eagerly at turn-start.  With the factory the
    runtime decision is evaluated per call site, never at turn-start, and
    the memo prevents the cold-start-every-call pattern that lingered after
    PR-3.  The declared sandbox profile remains the execution contract:
    [Local] resolves to [None] even when DockerPlayground is enabled.

    The dependency on {!Keeper_sandbox_docker} stays acyclic:
    [keeper_sandbox_docker] only consumes [Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.t]
    as a parameter and never constructs one itself. *)

    variant which always inherits the host network). *)

val resolve :

  Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.t option
(** Returns [Some runtime] when {!Keeper_sandbox_runner.effective_sandbox_profile}
    yields [Docker]. [in_playground] is derived from [cwd] vs the
    keeper's playground root for runtime workspace reuse only. Memoizes per
    [(in_playground, network_mode)] so subsequent calls reuse the same
    container. *)

val resolve_opt :
  t option ->
  cwd:string ->
  Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.t option
(** Convenience wrapper: [None] when [t option] is [None], otherwise
    delegates to {!resolve}.  Lets call sites that previously matched
    on [Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.t option] keep the same shape after
    the factory rewrite. *)

val cleanup : t -> unit
(** Tears down every runtime created via {!resolve}.  Idempotent. *)
