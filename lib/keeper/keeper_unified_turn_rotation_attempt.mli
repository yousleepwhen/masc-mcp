(** Pure reducer for cascade rotation attempt receipt rows.

    The keeper turn driver owns impure timing and mutable accumulation. This
    module owns the deterministic projection from a degraded retry decision plus
    its terminal error into the receipt row persisted at the end of the turn. *)
