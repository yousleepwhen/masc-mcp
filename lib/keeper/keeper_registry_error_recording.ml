(** Keeper error recording (Log + Prometheus dedup + last_error persistence).

    Extracted from keeper_registry.ml (lines 456-506) as part of the
    godfile decomp campaign. The MASC/OAS Error-Warn Reduction Goal §P6
    deduplication logic + first/repeated emit policy lives here; the
    final CAS write to [last_error] goes through
    [Keeper_registry.set_last_error_entry] so this module does not need
    to know about the central Atomic. *)

  (* MASC/OAS Error-Warn Reduction Goal §P6: same (keeper, error) was
     emitting at ERROR up to 96× in 30-min slices on production
     (system_log_2026-05-16 sample, 299 events/day; verifier
     sandbox_docker ~48%). First occurrence keeps ERROR — operators
     must still see *new* failure modes. Repeated occurrences demote
     to DEBUG and bump a Prometheus counter so the dashboard still
     reflects the retry rate without paging operators.

     WORKAROUND-CARRYOVER: this is symptom suppression. The root fix
     is the underlying error source (verifier sandbox docker exec,
     path-syntax guard, stale-turn timeouts). Tracked as separate PRs
     keyed on the [Keeper_recording_error_state.error_kind] buckets. *)
