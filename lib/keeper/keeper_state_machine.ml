        Before this event existed, the field was read in [derive_phase]
        but never set in OCaml — the right disjunct of the Paused
        promotion ([context_overflow] /\ [compact_retry_exhausted]) was
        dead code. The retry-loop in [keeper_unified_turn] paused the
        keeper via [Operator_pause] instead, conflating "operator paused"
        with "auto-compact retry budget exhausted" on dashboards.

        Dispatchers should fire this BEFORE [Operator_pause] so the
        Paused phase carries the real reason (budget exhaustion) for
        observability, while the existing first disjunct
        ([operator_paused]) still drives derive_phase deterministically. *)

     fiber subsequently exits. This is correct: the drain succeeded,
