   Classification (plan §1 4-way):
     Note A — Resolved. Priority 2 Offline (launch_pending AND
       ~fiber_alive) is mirrored by
       specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperLaunchPending.tla, a 3-phase
       projection (Offline / Running / Dead) with bug-action
       FiberStartedWithoutClearing. The lifecycle audit cites
       keeper_registry.ml:340 (set), this file:520 (clear in FSM),
       keeper_registry.ml:407 (clear on death) — all three sources
       are anchored in the spec's source-citation block.
     Note B — Refinement (acknowledged). Priority 6 OCaml clause
       `context_overflow AND compact_retry_exhausted -> Paused` is
       stricter than spec line 96 (operator_paused only). Without it
       Overflowed -> Compacting loops indefinitely when retries are
       exhausted; KeeperReconcileLiveness scope deliberately excludes
       compact retry semantics, which live in KeeperCompactionLifecycle.
     Note C — Partition (acknowledged). Overflowed phase derivation
       lives in KeeperCompactionLifecycle.tla; KeeperReconcileLiveness
       omits it because reconcile liveness is independent of overflow.
       Multi-spec coverage by design, not drift.

   C1 follow-up scope (plan §3, sequenced):
     - Phase 1 (per-priority): convert each branch to `let try_<action>
       state` mirroring the corresponding TLA+ Next-action enablement.
     - Phase 2 (compile-time): exhaustiveness ratchet — every spec
       action has exactly one OCaml try_ counterpart.
     - Phase 3 (optional, plan §11.1 not adopted by default): runtime
       gate `emit_phase_transition` — review hook only, not production. *)

     Design note: stop_requested + drain_complete -> Stopped is checked
     BEFORE fiber_alive checks. This means a keeper that completed its
     drain cleanly (drain_complete=true) reaches Stopped even if the
     fiber subsequently exits. This is correct: the drain succeeded,
     so the keeper should be Stopped, not Crashed.

     However, if the fiber dies DURING drain (drain_complete=false),
     the fiber_alive checks fire first and the keeper goes to Crashed.
     This is also correct: the drain did not complete.

     TLA+ model checking (TLC) found a deadlock where Stopped is entered
     while compaction_active or handoff_active is still TRUE. This is a
     semantic contradiction: drain_complete means ALL work is finished,
     which includes buffer operations. Guard Stopped against active buffer
     ops so the keeper stays in Draining until compaction/handoff exits. *)

(** Compute entry actions for a phase transition.
    [Publish_lifecycle] is always consumed by the registry runtime.
    [Start_compaction] is additionally consumed for the auto-compact
    [Overflowed] path; the remaining variants stay descriptive here
    because their side effects are still owned elsewhere
    (post-turn lifecycle or supervisor).

    Structure (Iteration 2, /loop FSM drift hunt — Phase A-2):
    Outer match is on [new_phase] so every phase variant is exhaustively
    enumerated and the compiler warns on future phase addition. Inner
    matches on [prev_phase] enumerate every variant explicitly (no
    wildcard) so the same future-proofing applies to prev-dependent arms.
    Pre-refactor behaviour is preserved verbatim — the four classes that
    previously fell through the [| _ -> []] catch-all (transitions into
    Offline, Crashed, into Running from non-{Restarting,Failing,Paused},
    into Restarting from non-Crashed) now return [] from explicit arms

(* ── Event preconditions (R-A-9 minimal layer) ──────────

   TLA+ KeeperStateMachine.tla enumerates state preconditions per
   action (e.g. CompactRetryExhausted requires
   [context_overflow /\ ~compaction_active /\ ~compact_retry_exhausted]).
   [update_conditions] is a pure record-update and ignores them — a
   mis-ordered caller can set [compact_retry_exhausted = TRUE] on a
   non-overflowed keeper, which then latches the keeper into [Paused]
   the next time an overflow event arrives (silent forced operator
   intervention).

   This helper enforces a subset of those preconditions at the
   [apply_event] boundary so silent corruption becomes a typed
   [Precondition_violation] result.  Coverage extended incrementally
   across the spec/code refinement chain (R-A-9, then R-A-6.b):
     - PR-1: Compact_retry_exhausted (latch correctness)
     - PR-2: Context_overflow_detected, Auto_compact_triggered (overflow
       lifecycle — the two events that drive Overflowed↔Compacting)
     - PR-3: Operator_compact_requested (operator-driven buffer op
       exclusivity).  Operator_clear_requested is deliberately *not*
       arm-enforced beyond the terminal guard — see its arm below for
       the operator escape-hatch rationale.
     - R-A-6.b: Restart_budget_exhausted (non-idempotency — pairs with
       §S3 BudgetNeverRevives liveness invariant; iter 14 audit).

   Coverage: 5/5 R-A-9 events (Compact_retry_exhausted,
   Context_overflow_detected, Auto_compact_triggered,
   Operator_compact_requested, Operator_clear_requested) plus the
   adjacent R-A-6.b Restart_budget_exhausted arm (iter 14 follow-up).
   Other events have no spec preconditions beyond NotTerminal and
   fall through the catch-all.
