(** Reconcile-gate restore path, extracted from
    [keeper_supervisor.ml] (godfile decomp).

    [restore_reconcile_continue_gate] rehydrates a pending
    "keeper_continue_after_reconcile" approval entry from the
    persisted paused meta. On [Approve | Edit], it forwards to
    [resume_keeper_after_reconcile_gate] (which itself lives in
    [Keeper_supervisor_resume_reconcile_gate] — we call it directly
    here, passing the injected [~supervise_keepalive] callback, to
    avoid bouncing through the parent's wrapper).

    On [Reject], it logs the reason, increments
    [metric_keeper_supervisor_cleanup_failures] tagged
    [Reconcile_gate_rejected], and leaves the keeper paused. *)
