(** State-aware cascade profile selection.

    Maps keeper phase to an effective cascade profile name. The keeper's
    base cascade (from persona/team config) is overridden when the current
    phase calls for a cheaper or faster model.

    Pure function — mirrors TLA+ KeeperCoreTriad.SelectCascade action.

(** Select the effective cascade profile for the current turn.

    [~base_cascade] is the keeper's configured cascade name.

    Routing rules (TLA+ mirrored, with logical route names resolved through
    [cascade.toml] [routes]):
    - [Running], [Draining], [Paused] -> [base_cascade]
    - [Failing] -> [routes.phase_recovery]
    - [Compacting], [HandingOff] -> [routes.phase_buffer]
    - [Overflowed], terminal/non-executable phases -> [base_cascade]

    This helper is total: even phases that are blocked upstream still return
    a routing decision so dashboards/tests can inspect the same contract.
    The keeper cycle gate remains the owner of "can this phase execute a turn?" *)

(** Preserve an already-routed cascade while carrying the tool requirement
