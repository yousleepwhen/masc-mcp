(** Keeper Composite Lifecycle Observer — pure projection.

    Projects a [Keeper_registry.registry_entry] into a composite snapshot
    spanning Decision / Cascade / Memory / Compaction sub-FSMs as
    specified in RFC-0003 and
    [specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperCompositeLifecycle.tla].

    Contract:
    - Pure read. No mutation, no I/O, no event emission.
    - Never calls [Keeper_state_machine.apply_event],
      [Keeper_cascade_routing.select_cascade], or any routine that would
      shift keeper lifecycle state.
    - Does not read provider names, token counts, or context bytes —
      those belong to OAS (see [feedback_masc-oas-layer-boundary]).

    Current scope: all projected sub-FSM live states are written directly
    into [Keeper_registry.registry_entry]. The observer no longer infers
    decision/cascade/compaction state from coarse parent conditions.
