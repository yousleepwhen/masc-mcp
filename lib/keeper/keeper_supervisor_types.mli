(** Keeper_supervisor_types — pure type definitions and helpers extracted
    from Keeper_supervisor (2632 LoC godfile).

    Holds cohort + persona-drift types + their pure helpers. State-touching
    supervisor operations remain in Keeper_supervisor. Re-included by
    Keeper_supervisor so existing callers continue to use
    [Keeper_supervisor.supervision_cohort] etc. unchanged. *)
