(** Keeper_unified_prompt — Build a single unified prompt from keeper identity
    and world observation.

    Only reactive triggers and resource state are included in the user message.
    Metacognition sections (tool activity, cycle outcome, diversity, behavioral
    stats) removed in #6814; telemetry preserved via decision_audit.

(** Generic STATE formatting instruction for normal keeper turns. Turn-level
    output guards can override this when continuity is runtime-managed. *)

(** Build unified system prompt and user message from keeper state.

    Returns [(system_prompt, user_message)] where:
    - [system_prompt] contains keeper identity, instructions, and turn intent
    - [user_message] contains reactive triggers + resource state only
