(** Keeper_post_turn — post-turn lifecycle: compaction, handoff
    rollover, continuity summary, and overflow retry recovery.

    Orchestrates the end-of-turn pipeline that decides whether to
    compact the context, roll over to a new generation, and update
    the continuity summary from the latest state snapshot.

    This module owns only the checkpoint/lineage tail of a keeper
    turn. Memory bank append, episode flush, and Hebbian learning
    are recorded elsewhere:
    - memory bank / episodes: [Keeper_agent_run] tail after [Agent.run]
    - hebbian: task lifecycle in [Coord_task]

    Extracted from Keeper_context_runtime as part of #4955 god-file split. *)

    strategy actually ran; [trigger] is the gate label that fired
    ([ratio]/[messages]/[tokens]/[tool_heavy]). *)

(** End-of-turn pipeline. Decides compaction, rolls over generations

    {b Tier A5} (Cycle 22): when the [MASC_AUTONOMOUS] environment
    variable is on (see {!Autonomous.Wirein_helpers.masc_autonomous_enabled}),
    the resulting [post_turn_lifecycle.checkpoint]'s working_context
    is enriched with an ["autonomous_meta"] sub-tree carrying the
    suspended {!Autonomous_bridge} state. Off-mode behaviour is
    unchanged (zero impact). *)

(** Apply the keeper post-turn lifecycle with explicit resilience handles.

    Valid combinations of the two resilience arguments are:
    - both [None]: no audit envelope, no recovery side effect.
    - both [Some]: the feature-flagged resilience wire-in writes a
      durable [RecoveryAttempted] envelope through the audit store
      before invoking the executor, preserving auditability.

    Passing [resilience_strategy_executor:(Some _)] together with
    [resilience_audit_store:None] is rejected ({!Invalid_argument})
    because retry/fallback/handoff/abort callbacks would mutate
    live state without the pre-flight envelope that
    [keeper_bridge] relies on.

    @raise Invalid_argument when an executor is supplied without an
      audit store.

    Concurrency: [Shared_audit.Store.t] is a mutable single-writer
    chain ([latest_hash] + append with no internal locking).  The
    same store instance must not be threaded through concurrent
    keeper turns — sharing one across fibers can produce envelopes
    with duplicate [prev_hash] values and break audit-chain
    verification.  Callers own serialization; the typical pattern
    is one store per keeper, owned by the keeper bridge. *)
