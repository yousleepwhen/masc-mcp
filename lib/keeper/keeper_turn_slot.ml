(** Force-release every slot recorded for [keeper_name] in [holder_table].
    Called by the supervisor when a keeper has been declared crashed but
    its fiber has not returned through the [Fun.protect] finally branch
    in [with_keeper_turn_slot] — typically because the LLM subprocess
    swallowed the cancellation and never produced [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled].

    Returns the list of [(label, age_sec)] pairs that were force-released
    so the supervisor can stamp the diagnosis onto the keeper meta. The
    list is empty when nothing was held.

    Idempotency / over-release: the natural release path
    ([release_keeper_turn_slot]) checks [state.acquired_*] flags before
    calling [Eio.Semaphore.release]. After force-release the holder
    table no longer has the entry, but the keeper's [slot_state] flags
    remain set — so a late-returning fiber will release the semaphore a
    second time, raising the count above [reactive_turn_limit] briefly
    (Eio counting semaphores allow over-release safely; the count just
    re-converges on the next saturation). The bounded over-release is
    accepted as the cost of unblocking the fleet — the alternative
    ([slot_state] reaching the supervisor across closures) would
    require shared mutable state that the current architecture
    deliberately keeps closure-local.

    2026-05-05 motivation: 16 keepers held [reactive_slot] for 18-25
    minutes each behind LLM subprocess hangs while
    [reactive_available=0]. The existing [force_unresolved_watchdog_crash]
    path stamps the keeper as crashed but does not return the slot, so
    the next cohort of keepers waits another 180s on
    [acquire_bounded] and trips the same idle-turn watchdog. *)

(* PR-M (Leak 9): consecutive [provider_timeout] cycle FAILED strikes
   per keeper.

   [provider_timeout] is the canonical policy surface for the legacy
   structured timeout-budget path
   (see [Keeper_unified_turn.resolve_bounded_provider_timeout_budget_with_turn_budget]).
   Re-running on the same fiber gives the same context and the same
   shape of failure repeats, but provider/cascade budget pressure is not
   keeper fiber corruption. Crossing [provider_timeout_strike_limit]
   is therefore routed through [Keeper_failure_policy] before any
   lifecycle effect is applied. Without independent keeper-liveness
   loss, the keeper stays alive while provider cooldown, cascade
   backpressure, and turn retry policy do the actual throttling.

   Counter is in-memory for the common same-server case and is reset on
   any successful turn (see [Ok updated] branch). On first bump after a
   process restart, callers may seed it from the persisted
   [Provider_timeout_loop] failure reason so restart cannot erase a
   partially observed loop. *)
