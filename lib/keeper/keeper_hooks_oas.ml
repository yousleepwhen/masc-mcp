(** Keeper_hooks_oas — OAS hooks adapter for Keeper Agent.run().

    Maps keeper-specific behaviors (checkpoint, metrics, social events,
    safety gates) to OAS hook events.

    Safety checks in [pre_tool_use]:
    - Cost budget: reject tool calls when accumulated cost exceeds limit
    - Destructive patterns: reject bash/edit tools with dangerous commands
      (rm -rf, drop table, force push, etc.)

    These checks were previously in [Eval_gate.guarded_execute] and are
    now natively integrated into the Agent.run() hook lifecycle.

    @since Phase 4 — Keeper → Agent.run() migration
    @since Phase 7 — Eval_gate → OAS hooks migration *)


(** Keeper deny list — derived from Tool_catalog surface SSOT.

    by operators or through controlled workflows.

(* [escape_field], [render_inline_skip_reason], [broadcast_tool_skipped],
   and [extract_command_from_input] now live in [Keeper_guards]. They
   are used only by the decomposed pre_tool_use guard chain, so keeping
   them there avoids a circular dependency and concentrates the
   gate-level concerns in one module. *)

(** Derive a provider label from a model id.

    Benchmarking downstream (e.g. 15-keeper cascade weighted_random turns)
    needs to group costs.jsonl rows by provider. The raw [model] field
    mixes two conventions:
    - prefixed: [glm-coding:glm-5-turbo], [claude:claude-haiku-4-5-20251001]
    - bare: [glm-5-turbo], [claude-haiku-4-5-20251001] (emitted by some
      OAS transports that strip the scheme before reporting)

    Prefer the prefix when present; otherwise fall back to a minimal
    heuristic over known bare-name shapes. Returns [unknown] rather
    than guessing when no rule fits, so analysis queries can filter
    those rows out rather than miscount them. *)

(** Build OAS hooks for a keeper agent.

    1. Cost budget — reject when accumulated cost exceeds limit
    2. Destructive pattern detection — reject dangerous bash/edit commands
    3. Cost event emission — auto-emit per-turn cost to .masc/costs.jsonl

    @param meta_ref Mutable ref to keeper metadata
    @param generation Current generation counter
    @param max_cost_usd Optional cost budget (rejects tool calls above limit)
    @param destructive_check Enable destructive pattern detection (default true)
    @param pre_tool_use_guard Optional callback that can short-circuit a tool
           before execution by returning an inline override response.
    @param on_tool_executed Optional callback after each tool execution
    @param trajectory_acc Optional trajectory accumulator for cost attribution

(** Pure decision logic for the on_idle hook.  Testable without Coord.config.

    Graduated response to repeated tool calls uses the configured
    [Env_config_keeper.KeeperKeepalive.idle_skip_threshold]:
    - For idle counts below [skip_at - 1]: gentle nudge suggesting alternatives
    - For idle counts at [skip_at - 1]: final warning (stronger nudge)
      suggesting [stay_silent]
    - For idle counts at or above [skip_at]: Skip (end this turn, but the
      heartbeat loop will retry next cycle)

    The [~allowed_tools] parameter enables concrete alternative suggestions
    instead of generic "try a different tool" messages. This is the
    deterministic envelope providing structured options for the
    non-deterministic LLM to choose from.

    Skip is not death. The keeper's heartbeat loop will schedule a new
    turn on the next cycle with fresh context. The key insight is that
    burning more tokens on a stuck LLM is worse than retrying later. *)
