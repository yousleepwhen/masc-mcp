(** Keeper_passive_loop_detector — detect keepers stuck in no-progress loops.

    A "passive loop" is N consecutive turns where the LLM only called
    read-only / status tools ([Passive_status] class in
    [Keeper_tool_progress]) without any execution or completion action.
    This is the proactive-turn equivalent of the stay-silent loop: the
    keeper is cycling but making no progress on its owned task.

    Detection triggers a [metric_keeper_passive_loop_detected_total]
    Prometheus counter (latched per episode, resets on any
    [Execution] or [Completion] turn) and a structured WARN log.
