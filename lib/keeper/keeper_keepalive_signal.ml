   Each helper is wrapped at the call site by
   [Keeper_fsm_guard_runtime.wrap_unit], so an [Assert_failure] from a
   PPX-injected guard increments the Prometheus violation counter and
   re-raises. The bug-action [MissedWakeup] is
   intentionally NOT instrumented — it is the failure mode these guards
   are designed to detect, not to enforce. *)

(* Heartbeat turn lifecycle flag, mirroring KeeperHeartbeat.tla's
   [turn_state] in the {"idle", "running"} alphabet. Read inside
   identity helpers; written by the caller around [run_heartbeat_loop]
   and the dispatch sites. Single-fiber by construction — only the

   returns. The honest path is trivially true; the guard catches a
   regression where someone updates [persist_directive_meta_update] to

   re-sets the atomic to TRUE between the CAS and this read would make
   the guard fire. The [interruptible_sleep] body is single-fiber and
