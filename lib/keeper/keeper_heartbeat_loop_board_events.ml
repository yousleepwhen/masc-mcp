(** Pending board-event collection for the keeper heartbeat loop.
    Extracted from [keeper_heartbeat_loop.ml] (godfile decomp).

    Single helper that, once the proactive-warmup phase has elapsed,
    queries [Keeper_world_observation.collect_board_events] for the
    keeper's pending board events and returns them paired with the
    current meta. Cancellation is re-raised; any other exception is
    logged + counted via the heartbeat-failure Prometheus counter
    (phase="board_count_query") and treated as zero pending events. *)
