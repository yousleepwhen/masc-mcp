(** Turn event-bus summary record + helpers.

    Captures the within-turn observations emitted by
    [Agent_sdk.Event_bus] — correlation/run identifiers, observed
    overflow-imminent events, and context-compaction counters —
    rolled up into a single [turn_event_bus_summary] record that the
    keeper's post-turn handler attaches to the receipt.

    Pure data + a left-biased merge (left wins on the
    string-id and overflow_imminent slots; right wins on
    last_compaction; counters sum). Verbatim extract from
    [Keeper_turn_cascade_budget]; the parent retains transparent
    record aliases + 2 value aliases. *)
