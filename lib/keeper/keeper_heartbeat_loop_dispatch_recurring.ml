(** Recurring-task keepalive dispatch, extracted from
    [keeper_heartbeat_loop.ml] (godfile decomp).

    Per heartbeat cycle, attempts to:

    1. Re-enable transiently-broadcast-failed recurring tasks that
       were previously auto-disabled by [Keeper_recurring.dispatch_due]'s
       [max_failures] guard (without this re-enable step the keeper
       falls silent for the lifetime of the process and triggers
       stale-kill cascades).
    2. Dispatch all due tasks via [Keeper_recurring.dispatch_due],
       broadcasting each via [Coord.broadcast] tagged
       [\[loop:<label>\] <msg>]. Per-task broadcast failures tick
       [metric_keeper_recurring_failures] with [phase="task_execution"]
       and surface as [Error] in the inner result. The outer try/with
       catches dispatch-loop errors and ticks the same metric with
       [phase="dispatch_error"].

    Returns the count of tasks dispatched (or 0 on dispatch-loop failure).
    Cancellation re-raises. *)
