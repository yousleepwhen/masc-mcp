    Runs once per turn before dispatching to {!Agent_sdk.Agent.run}: applies
    the compaction policy with [cooldown_sec=0] (a forced one-shot
    evaluation distinct from the regular cooldown-gated policy), then
    resolves the resume checkpoint slot.  Extracted from
    {!Keeper_agent_run} so the compaction-policy evaluation can be
    tested without driving the full turn pipeline. *)

    1. Forces a fresh compaction evaluation by overriding
       [meta.compaction.cooldown_sec] to [0].
       The evaluation is scoped to restored checkpoint/history state.
       Fresh turn substrate such as the system prompt, tool catalog, and
       current user assignment is measured by wake-payload telemetry but
       is not checkpoint history that this function can compact.
    2. Calls {!Keeper_compact_policy.compact_if_needed_typed}; populates
       [before_tokens] / [after_tokens] / [trigger] / [decision] from
       the result.
    3. When [loaded_checkpoint_present] is [false], skips checkpoint
       resolution entirely — the dispatch starts a fresh OAS run.
    4. When checkpoint resolution is required and compaction did
       fire, calls [save_checkpoint] to persist the compacted state.
       On save failure the result carries no resume checkpoint, and
       [save_error] surfaces the detail so the caller can block dispatch.
    5. When no compaction fired, returns a derived resume checkpoint
       with the same message-count, old-tool-result, per-block, and
       total-content caps used by checkpoint persistence. *)
