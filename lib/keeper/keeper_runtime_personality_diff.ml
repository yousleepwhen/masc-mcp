(** Personality-text drift diagnostic helpers for keeper runtime.

    Compares the persisted [keeper_meta] personality fields against
    the TOML-source persona defaults using
    [Keeper_personality_io.compare_normalized], surfacing per-field
    drift with byte-length + first-diff-offset diagnostics. Used by
    runtime re-sync logging on the cycle where a re-sync actually
    fires.

    Pure functions over [Keeper_personality_io.coerced_personality]
    + [Keeper_config.prompt_render_max_bytes]. Verbatim extract from
    the head of [Keeper_runtime]; the parent retains 4 single-line
    value aliases. *)

(** #10269: trimmed text equality used by re-sync decision.  Wraps each
    input as a [will] field of a [coerced_personality] record then
    delegates to [Keeper_personality_io.compare_normalized]. *)

    shape from [personality_field_diff_entry]:
    [field(raw_meta_len=N raw_target_len=N trim_meta=S trim_target=S)]
    so dashboards can distinguish raw-length drift from trimmed-content
    drift.  Returns [None] when the two trim-equal so steady-state
    keepers stay quiet.  Trimmed previews truncated to 32 bytes each
    to keep a wide [instructions] field log-friendly. *)
