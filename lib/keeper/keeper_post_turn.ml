(** Keeper_post_turn — post-turn lifecycle: compaction, handoff rollover,
    continuity summary, and overflow retry recovery.

    Orchestrates the end-of-turn pipeline that decides whether to compact
    the context, roll over to a new generation, and update the continuity
    summary from the latest state snapshot.

    This module owns only the checkpoint/lineage tail of a keeper turn.
    Memory bank append, episode flush, and Hebbian learning are recorded
    elsewhere:
    - memory bank / episodes: [Keeper_agent_run] tail after [Agent.run]
    - hebbian: task lifecycle in [Coord_task]

    Extracted from Keeper_exec_context as part of #4955 god-file split.

    Spec navigation (OCaml -> TLA+) — plan §19 anchor pattern.  Sibling
    to #11612 (Cycle 31, [keeper_rollover.ml]).  Authoritative spec
    mirror is [specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperGenerationLineage.tla].

    Spec lines 10-13 already cite this module as one of three modeled
    OCaml sources:
      - lib/keeper/keeper_post_turn.ml   (this file — post-turn pipeline)
      - lib/keeper/keeper_rollover.ml    (rollover semantics — anchored
                                          in #11612)
      - lib/keeper/keeper_types.mli      (type lineage — anchor deferred)

    This block is the reverse-direction citation so code search for
    "KeeperGenerationLineage" lands here.

    Post-turn -> spec mapping:
      Compaction phase    feeds into [keeper_phase] = "running" while
                          the in-flight turn is still resolving.
      Handoff rollover    delegates to [Keeper_rollover.attempt] and
                          increments [meta.generation] — spec's
                          generation variable.  The new trace_id and
                          trace_history append happen there.
      Continuity summary  refreshes the [meta.continuity_summary] /
                          checkpoint pair after rollover, preserving
                          the spec's [ckpt_valid] / [ckpt_generation]
                          parity invariant.

    Spec scope (line 4-8): same identity across generations,
    trace_id replacement, append-only ancestry, checkpoint lineage
    parity once back to idle.

    Spec out-of-scope (line 15-18 in spec): compaction strategy
    selection (KeeperCompactionLifecycle), Agent.run turn loop,
    long-term memory recall.  This module *triggers* compaction but
    does not *select* the strategy. *)
