(** In-container login provider — Option B credential lifecycle.

    Manages credential materialisation for keepers that use [gh auth
    login --with-token] inside the container (Option B in RFC-0008), as
    opposed to the host-mounted config dir approach (Option A in
    {!Keeper_host_config_provider}).

    The F-1 gate ([provider_gate]) rejects credentials whose token
    SHA-256 matches the operator's ambient token — this prevents the
    keeper from acting as the operator.  The [Keeper_credential_provider.S]
    lifecycle stubs are included as scaffolding for subsequent PRs
    (F-2 hosts.yml rewrite, temp-file management, tear_down cleanup). *)

(** F-1 security gate: reject when the keeper's token hash matches the
    operator's ambient token.  This prevents the keeper subprocess from
    inheriting the operator's repo CLI identity — a confused-deputy
    scenario where the keeper would push commits, create PRs, etc. as
    the operator.

    Both tokens are SHA-256-hex-compared to avoid timing attacks on
    raw-string equality (constant-time comparison on fixed-length hex
    strings of 64 chars). *)

(** Constant-time hex string comparison for fixed-length SHA-256 output.

    Uses [String.equal] on 64-char hex strings, which is a fixed-length
    comparison (no early exit on first differing byte in practice, since
    OCaml's [String.equal] is a memcmp-based comparison on strings of
    equal length).  Exposed for unit testing the comparison semantics. *)
