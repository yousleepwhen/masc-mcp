(** Keeper State Machine — Deterministic Core (RFC-0002).

    This module defines the 13-state keeper lifecycle as a pure state machine.
    All functions are deterministic: no I/O, no clock reads, no mutable state.

    Phase count history:
      - 11 phases at RFC-0002 Phase 1 introduction (#5229, 2026-04-05)
      - +1 → 12 when [Overflowed] was added (MASC-1, 2026-04)
      - +1 → 13 when [Zombie] was added (#14707, /loop iter 4)
    Single Source of Truth (SSOT) is the [type phase] declaration below;
    spec doc counts are
    cross-checked by [scripts/audit-tla-phase-count.sh] (R-H-1.c #14874).

    Architecture:
    - Layer 3 (NonDet Shell): measurements captured via [Keeper_measurement]
    - Layer 2 (Det Core): THIS MODULE — events x conditions -> phase transitions
    - Layer 1 (Storage): [Keeper_registry] applies transitions atomically

    Key invariant: given the same [conditions] and [event], [apply_event]
    always produces the same [transition_result]. *)

(** {1 Phase (13-State Enum)} *)

(** Fine-grained keeper lifecycle phase.
    Buffer states ([Failing], [Overflowed], [Compacting], [HandingOff],
    [Draining], [Restarting]) are observable intermediaries between
    stable states. *)
type phase =
  | Offline       (** Registered but no heartbeat fiber started *)
  | Running       (** Healthy heartbeat loop executing *)
  | Failing       (** Consecutive failures detected, probing recovery *)
  | Overflowed    (** Prompt exceeded provider max context; auto-compact
                      pending. Transient: [entry_actions_for] emits
                      [Start_compaction] so the next event-loop iteration
                      derives [Compacting]. Distinguishes "context overflow"
                      from generic [Failing] for operator observability. *)
  | Compacting    (** Context compaction in progress *)
  | HandingOff    (** Generation rollover in progress *)
  | Draining      (** Graceful shutdown: completing current turn *)
  | Paused        (** Operator-paused or auto-compact-retry-exhausted,
                      fiber sleeping *)
  | Stopped       (** Clean exit, terminal *)
  | Crashed       (** Unrecoverable error, restart candidate *)
  | Restarting    (** Supervisor backoff wait before re-launch *)
  | Dead          (** Restart budget exhausted, tombstone, terminal *)
  | Zombie        (** Terminal structural failure, non-recoverable.
                      Distinct from [Dead]: restart budget may remain,
                      but the keeper encountered a permanent provider
                      or adapter error and cannot continue. *)

    {2 Paired lifecycle event contract}

    [Compaction_started] / [Handoff_started] / their matching
    [_completed] / [_failed] events MUST be dispatched with an explicit
    lifecycle origin through {!Keeper_registry}. Normal turn-owned events
    use [Post_turn_lifecycle], which runs synchronously at the tail of a
    keeper turn (inside [Keeper_unified_turn.run_keeper_cycle] or the
    legacy [Keeper_turn] path). Manual compaction uses the narrower
    [Operator_compact] origin for compaction events only.

    The keepalive loop ({!Keeper_keepalive.run_heartbeat_loop}) does
    NOT explicitly gate dispatch on [phase]. It relies on the
    structural property that [Compaction_started] and [Handoff_started]
    are always paired with their [_completed] / [_failed] counterparts
    inside a single [run_keeper_cycle] call, so the next keepalive
    iteration can never observe the keeper in [Compacting] or
    [HandingOff] phase at its dispatch decision point.

    Violating this rule — for example, by emitting [Compaction_started]
    from a separate async monitor fiber while a turn is still in flight
    — reopens the {b KeepalivePhaseConsistency} safety bug formalized in
    [specs/bug-models/KeepalivePhaseConsistency.tla]. That spec's
    [NoDrainTransition] / [GhostDispatch] actions are the exact
    counterexamples TLC will find.

    If a future change needs another origin for these events, add it to
    the registry origin guard and re-verify the TLA+ spec against the new
    code path. *)

        reason ("auto-compact retry budget exhausted") for operator
        observability. Before this event existed, the
        [compact_retry_exhausted] field was read by [derive_phase]
        but never set in OCaml — the right disjunct of the Paused

(** {1 Core Functions} *)

(** Derive phase from conditions. Pure, priority-ordered.
    This is the SOLE function that determines keeper phase.

    Priority (first match wins) — mirrors the [DerivePhase] action in
    [specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperStateMachine.tla]:
    1.  Stopped (stop_requested + drain_complete + ~compaction_active +
                 ~handoff_active)
        -- Checked first because a clean drain wins even if the fiber
        subsequently exits.  Buffer-state guards prevent a TLC deadlock
        where Stopped is entered while compaction/handoff is still in
        flight (see comment on [keeper_state_machine.ml:derive_phase]).
    2.  Offline (launch_pending + ~fiber_alive) -- pre-start registration
    3.  Dead (~fiber_alive + ~restart_budget_remaining) -- terminal
    4.  Restarting (~fiber_alive + budget + backoff_elapsed)
    5.  Crashed (~fiber_alive + budget remaining)
    6.  Draining (stop_requested) -- in-progress stop
    7.  Failing (guardrail_triggered)
    8.  Paused (operator_paused OR context_overflow + compact_retry_exhausted)
    9.  HandingOff (handoff_active)
    10. Compacting (compaction_active)
    11. Overflowed (context_overflow) -- transient, auto-compact pending
    12. Failing (~heartbeat_healthy OR ~turn_healthy)
    13. Running (fiber_alive)
    14. Offline (default fallback for inconsistent zero-state)

    Drift note: prior to this revision the docstring listed Dead as
    priority 1; the actual implementation has always checked Stopped
    first (the TLA+ spec agrees).  The order above is the ground truth
    enforced by [keeper_state_machine.ml] and TLC. *)

    return the new conditions. No phase derivation or transition checks.
    Exposed for structural testing (set/clear coverage). *)
val update_conditions : conditions -> event -> conditions

(** Apply an event to the current state: update conditions, derive new phase.
    Returns [Error] for events on terminal states (Stopped, Dead).

    Runtime contract:
    - [Running] and [Failing] may execute turns.
    - All other phases must skip OAS turn execution until the keeper
      re-enters an executable phase. *)

   No reverse alias here: wrapped-library cycle blocked the alias. *)

(** {1 Attribution envelope (Layer 1)}

    Convert a transition attempt (event + current state) into the typed
    attribution envelope used by SSE emitters.

    All keeper FSM transitions are [Det]: the comment above the [event]
    type declares the invariant that non-deterministic measurements must
    be translated into typed events at the boundary before reaching the
    state machine. *)
