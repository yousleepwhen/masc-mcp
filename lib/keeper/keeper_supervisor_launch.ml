(* #10993: persona drift visibility.

   [Keeper_identity.normalize_all_names ~check_persona:true] runs on
   every dispatch via [Tool_inline_dispatch_coord] (RFC P3-a
   logging-only mode), but its [Persona_not_found] branch emits a
   Log.Misc.warn that is hard to triage:

   - WARN level (alert ROC blends with normal degradation noise).
   - Per-event (24h sample: 11 events × 5 keepers vs the underlying
     truth of 9 keepers permanently mis-configured), so operators can
     not tell whether the gap is widening or stable.
   - Lacks the per-keeper startup snapshot that would let an operator
     run a quick \[ls personas/\] and reconcile.

   Surface the gap once at supervise_keepalive entry — the code path
   that actually puts the keeper into the registry. Behaviour is
   unchanged (still proceeds with fallback) so the boot path stays
   compatible with the current 9-missing-personas fleet; the value is
   in turning a silent runtime drift into a single ERROR per keeper
   per supervisor restart.

   The visibility ERROR is bounded by fleet size (~14 keepers) and
   only fires on first registration — the [is_registered] guard above
   skips repeat calls. *)
