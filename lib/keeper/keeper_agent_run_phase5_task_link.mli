(** Link execution artifacts to the current task if one exists.

    Skipped when the (keeper, task, trace_id) tuple has already been
    linked — [Keeper_agent_run_turn_helpers.task_link_already_recorded]
    guards the call so that repeated linking does not produce backlog
    lock contention or event-feed noise.

    Best-effort: non-cancel exceptions are converted into [Error] and
    logged; [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] is re-raised. *)
