(** Keeper_recurring — In-memory recurring task registry.

    Keepers can register recurring tasks (broadcast, board post)
    that fire on a configurable interval.  The heartbeat loop calls
    [dispatch_due] each cycle to execute overdue tasks.

    Tasks are stored in memory only — they do not survive keeper restart.
    Re-register via MCP tools after restart if needed.

    Thread-safe: protected by Eio.Mutex when available. *)

    Tasks are auto-disabled by [dispatch_due] after [max_failures]
    consecutive failures; without periodic re-enable, the keeper's
    heartbeat broadcasts go silent permanently and dependent
    keepers eventually stale-kill the entire fleet.
