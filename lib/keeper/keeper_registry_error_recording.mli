(** Keeper error recording: log + Prometheus dedup + last_error persistence. *)

(** Record [err] on keeper [name].
    - First occurrence emits at ERROR (with [?details] sandbox context).
    - Repeated occurrences demote to DEBUG and bump
      [metric_keeper_recording_error_dedup] (label [error_kind]).
    - Also runs [Keeper_fd_pressure.note_if_fd_exhaustion] so an
      [EMFILE/ENFILE] burst still surfaces on the fd-pressure track.
    - Finally writes [last_error = Some err] through
      [Keeper_registry.set_last_error_entry] (CAS retry). *)
