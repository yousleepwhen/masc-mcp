(** Keeper Failure Circuit Breaker — detect repeated tool failures,
    inject corrective hints into error responses, and expose a bounded
    cooling state for observers.

    After [threshold] consecutive failures of the same error class,
    appends a corrective hint to the error message. A trip opens a
    short cooling window. Any later successful tool call closes the
    window immediately; otherwise observers auto-close it after
    [cooling_reset_sec].

(** Record a successful tool call (resets consecutive counter). *)
val record_success : keeper_name:string -> unit

(** Record an observed failure signature without incrementing the
    circuit-breaker streak or tripping the breaker. This keeps structural
    workflow rejections visible to the next-turn prompt while preserving
    their non-runtime-failure semantics. *)
val record_observed_failure : keeper_name:string -> error_msg:string -> unit

(** Enrich an error message with a corrective hint if the circuit
    breaker threshold has been reached. Returns the original message
    unchanged if under threshold, or message + hint if tripped. *)

(** {1 Failure signature diagnostics (task-240)}

    When the breaker trips, "3 consecutive other failures" on its own
    gives an operator no handle on *which* three failures caused it.
    To preserve that context, every [record_failure] call also writes a
    bounded-size signature (timestamp + class + fingerprint of the
    error message) to a per-keeper ring buffer. The trip log line
    names the buffer contents, and downstream observers (dashboard,
    snapshot JSON) can read them via [recent_failures_of]. *)

  ts : float;

}

(** Collapse an error message into a single-line, size-bounded
    fingerprint suitable for logs and JSON payloads. Default
    [max_len = 120]. Not cryptographic — pattern-matching only. *)
val fingerprint_of_error : ?max_len:int -> string -> string

(** Last-N failure signatures for [keeper_name] (newest first). Returns
    [[]] for keepers that have never failed. N is bounded internally
    (currently 3, matching the trip threshold). *)
val recent_failures_of : keeper_name:string -> failure_signature list

(** Recent failure signatures to inject into the next turn prompt for
    [keeper_name]. Includes the keeper's own recent failures plus bounded
    fleet-level failures observed from other keepers, deduplicated by
    class/fingerprint so a freshly-started keeper can avoid a live
    fleet-wide tool-call trap before it repeats the same failure. *)
val recent_failures_for_prompt : keeper_name:string -> failure_signature list

(** JSON snapshot of all breaker states for diagnostics.

    Each entry adds a [recent_failures] array (newest first):
    {[ { "ts": 1..., "class": "other", "fingerprint": "..." } ]}
    and circuit state fields:
    {[ { "display_state": "cooling", "last_tripped_at": 1... } ]}
    *)

(** {1 Observable display state (LT-16-KCB)}

    The internal breaker advances through several micro-states during
    [record_failure], but [tripped] is NOT stable — on trip, the
    function resets [consecutive_count] to 0, increments historical
    [total_tripped], and opens a time-bounded cooling window. Any
    snapshot taken between tool calls therefore reports one of three
    stable states:

    - ["clean"]   — never failed: [consecutive_count = 0] AND
                    no active cooling window.
    - ["warning"] — partial failure streak: [consecutive_count > 0]
                    (always below [threshold] because a trip resets it).
    - ["cooling"] — recently tripped: [consecutive_count = 0] AND
                    the latest trip has not been closed by success or
                    [cooling_reset_sec] expiry.

    Exposed so downstream observers (the composite-FSM matrix, test
    harnesses) can classify a KCB snapshot without reaching into the
    private mutable record.

(** Display state derived from raw counter values. *)
type display_state =
  | Clean
  | Warning
  | Cooling

(** Legacy pure classifier:
    [derive_display_state ~consecutive_count ~total_tripped].
    Does not care about [threshold] — [consecutive_count] above threshold
    cannot occur in a well-formed record (the mutator resets on trip),
    so any non-zero count is classified as [Warning]. This preserves the
    historical snapshot interpretation when no trip timestamp is present. *)

  consecutive_count:int ->

(** Lower-case string rendering ([clean | warning | cooling]). *)
val display_state_to_string : display_state -> string

(** Per-keeper display state lookup. Returns [Clean] for keepers that
    have never entered the internal state table — matching the
    "never failed" semantic. Safe to call from any fiber; acquires
    the same read lock as {!snapshot_json}.

    Single-keeper alternative to classifying a whole snapshot — used by
    the composite observer so fleet snapshotting stays O(fleet). *)
val display_state_of :
  keeper_name:string ->
  display_state

(** Deterministic variant of {!display_state_of} for tests and replayed
    snapshots. Production callers should usually use {!display_state_of}. *)
val display_state_of_at :
  now:float ->
  keeper_name:string ->
  display_state

(** Walk the JSON produced by {!snapshot_json} and return an association
    list from [keeper_name] to its display state. Returns [Error msg] if
    the JSON is not shaped as expected. Useful for composite observers
    that need to fold KCB state into a fleet matrix row.

    Unknown / missing fields on a per-entry basis are skipped silently
    rather than failing the whole walk, so one malformed record does not
    hide the rest. *)
