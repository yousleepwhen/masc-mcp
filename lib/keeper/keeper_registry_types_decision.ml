(* Living-matrix documentation of the decision-stage transition relation.
   Forbidden [<active>_to_undecided] pairs are unrepresentable through
   the [decision_stage_active] target type (PR #14887 made
   [set_turn_decision_stage] reject them at compile time; this
   validator mirrors that invariant at the test surface).

   We pattern-match on the raw [decision_stage] / [decision_stage_active]
   variants — *not* on the packed GADT witnesses returned by
   [stage_to_witness] / [decision_stage_active_to_packed].  The packed
   wrappers existentially quantify away the witness phantom, after
   which the compiler can no longer see that [decision_stage_active]
   has no [Decision_active_undecided] constructor; Warning 8 then
   spuriously demands the unreachable [(Packed Decision_undecided,
   Packed Decision_undecided)] case (regression introduced by #14893).

   By matching directly on the source variants the exhaustiveness
   check ranges over the *actual* input domain: 4 [decision_stage]
   sources × 3 [decision_stage_active] targets = 12 admitted pairs,
   no false-positive cases.  Adding a new [decision_stage] or
   [decision_stage_active] constructor still fails Warning 8 here,
   preserving the original tripwire intent. *)
