    this cap are skipped for the current cycle and retry on the next
    heartbeat. *)

exception Semaphore_wait_timeout of float
(** Raised inside [with_keeper_turn_slot] when acquiring either the
    autonomous, reactive, or global turn semaphore exceeds
    [semaphore_wait_timeout_sec]. The float carries the wait cap so the

    a keeper failure. *)
