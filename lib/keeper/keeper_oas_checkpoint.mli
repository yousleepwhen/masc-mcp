(** Keeper_oas_checkpoint — lifecycle, checkpoint, and
    idle-detail helpers extracted from {!Cascade_runner}.

    Keeps side-effecting run helpers separate from the main
    build / resume / run orchestration so the orchestration
    module stays focused on Eio fiber composition.

    No internal helpers are hidden; the .mli pins each entry
    point's contract so a future refactor of the OAS Agent
    surface (Provider / Checkpoint / Types renames) fails here
    instead of at every call site in {!Cascade_runner}. *)

(** Publish a [Custom "masc.oas_worker.<event>"] event on the

    accepted but **ignored** — the function looks up the bus via
    [Masc_event_bus.get ()] internally; the parameter is kept
    for backwards-compatibility with callers that already thread
    the bus through, and for symmetry with sibling lifecycle
    publishers that do consume their bus argument.

    Optional [error] / [session_id] / [status] fields are
    included in the payload only when [Some] and non-empty
    after trim — empty strings are dropped to keep the JSON
    payload skinny for downstream SSE consumers. [attrs] carries
    non-sensitive structured runtime metadata such as provider
    kind, model, and endpoint path. *)

    When [checkpoint_sidecar] is supplied, builds the checkpoint
    via [Agent_sdk.Agent_checkpoint.build_checkpoint] threading the

(** Enrich an [Agent_sdk.Error.to_string] detail string with the name
    of the most recently called tool when the detail starts
    with ["Idle detected"]. For all other detail strings the
    input is returned unchanged.

    The "most recently called tool" is the last
    [Agent_sdk.Types.ToolUse { name }] block in the most recent
    [Assistant] message; when no such block exists the bare
    detail is returned.

    independently of the network-bound [run] function. *)
