(** Keeper Runtime — keeper reconciliation and keepalive bootstrap.

    Reconciles persisted keeper meta against on-disk personality / TOML and
    materialises boot-time defaults; spawns supervisor sweeps and existing
    keepalives during server bootstrap.  Runtime-only mutable state stays
    behind keeper runtime/execution modules. *)

(** {1 Personality compare helpers}

    [String.trim]-based compare alone produced a re-sync storm
    (see #10479): the persisted text exceeds
    [Keeper_config.prompt_render_max_bytes] for some keepers, which the
    read path normalises while [target_will] keeps the raw value.  These
    helpers normalise both sides before diffing so reconcile is
    idempotent. *)

val personality_text_equal : string -> string -> bool
(** [true] when two personality fields compare equal under the same
    byte-cap normalisation the prompt renderer uses. *)

val personality_field_diff_entry :
  string -> string -> string -> string option
(** [(field, current, target)] -> human-readable diff line, or [None]
    when the field already compares equal. *)

val personality_diff_summary : (string * string * string) list -> string list
(** Render a list of [(field, current, target)] tuples as diff lines. *)

val personality_field_diff_summary :
  field:string -> current:string -> target:string -> string option
(** Single-field convenience wrapper around
    [personality_field_diff_entry]. *)

(** {1 Boot meta materialization} *)

type boot_meta_resolution = {
  meta : Keeper_types.keeper_meta;

      (** [true] when the meta was synthesised from defaults rather than
          loaded from disk. *)

    looks bootable on disk. *)

val autoboot_excluded_keeper_reasons : Coord.config -> autoboot_exclusion list
(** Configured keepers skipped by autoboot with operator-facing reason labels. *)

val auto_recoverable_paused_keeper_names : ?now:float -> Coord.config -> string list
(** Configured, autoboot-enabled keepers that are currently paused but whose
    supervisor-owned auto-resume timer has elapsed.  These keepers remain
    excluded from {!bootable_keeper_names} until the supervisor clears
    [paused=false], but they are enough reason to start the supervisor sweep on
    cold boot. *)

val canonicalize_if_keeper : Coord.config -> string -> string
(** [canonicalize_if_keeper config name] returns [keeper-<n>-agent]
    when [name] (bare or already canonical) refers to a configured
    keeper, else returns [name] unchanged. Safe to apply at credential
    lookup sites: dashboard / admin / external MCP clients pass through
    untouched, keeper bare names get canonicalized so the bare-stub
    redirect path stops being load-bearing. (PR-3b1, AuthIdentityFSM
    invariant I1 IdentityBindsToken.) *)

    failure. *)

val effective_declarative_cascade_name :
  Keeper_types_profile.keeper_profile_defaults ->

    defaults; falls back to the profile default when the meta omits one. *)

val resynced_tool_access :
  Keeper_types_profile.keeper_profile_defaults ->
  Keeper_types.keeper_meta -> Keeper_types.tool_access
(** Re-derive the tool-access record after merging profile defaults so
    the meta-level [preset] and per-tool overrides stay consistent. *)

val ensure_keeper_meta :
  Coord.config ->
  string -> (Keeper_types.keeper_meta, string) result
(** Load the keeper meta for [keeper_name], materialising defaults from
    the profile when the on-disk meta is missing fields. *)

val supervisor_sweep_running : string -> bool
(** [true] when a supervisor sweep is currently registered for the
    keeper. *)

val stop_supervisor_sweep : string -> unit
(** Stop and forget the supervisor sweep for [keeper_name]; idempotent. *)
