    Bridges [Agent_tool_dispatch_runtime.execute_keeper_tool_call] dispatch

    execution reads the current context from [ctx_snapshot]

    keeper tools access the working context for status/metrics.

    [execute_keeper_tool_call_with_outcome] using [~name] as the
    INTERNAL tool name (telemetry SSOT). [~input_schema] is the
    internal tool schema used for pre-execution validation after
    [?translate_input] reshapes incoming JSON from a public alias
    schema to the internal payload (identity by default). *)

(** Build the keeper's full [tool_bundle]: internal tools +
    alias-registered (public name) tools that translate input to
    internal payloads. The cleanup thunk releases per-turn sandbox
    runtimes (Docker case). *)

(** Convenience over [make_tool_bundle] returning only [.tools]. *)
