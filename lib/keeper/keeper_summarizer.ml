(** [STATE]-aware summarizer for OAS compaction.

    OAS [Budget_strategy.reduce_for_budget] calls its summarizer with the
    oldest-N messages when the context ratio crosses the Emergency
    threshold. The default summarizer takes the first 100 chars of each
    message's first Text block and prefixes `[role]`. If a message begins
    with `[STATE]\n...`, those characters land verbatim in the produced
    summary, which the LLM then re-reads the next turn as the prefix of
    `[Summary of N earlier messages]`. That is the compaction-layer half
    of the resonance loop that Gen3 (PR #7647) closed only at the prompt
    injection layer.

    This module wraps the default summarizer after scrubbing
    `[STATE]...[/STATE]` blocks from every Text block. Consumers register
    it via [Agent_sdk.Builder.with_summarizer] on the agent they build.

    OAS/MASC boundary: OAS knows nothing about [STATE] markers (see
    feedback_oas-must-not-know-masc). This module lives on the MASC side
    and supplies the domain-aware callback through OAS's generic
    [Agent.options.summarizer] API added in OAS 0.152.0 (PR #973). OAS
    0.153.0 (PR #975) exported [Budget_strategy.default_summarizer] so we
    delegate to it directly instead of re-implementing the extractive
    logic here. *)

(* Observability for [STATE] block scrubbing.  The compaction-layer
   resonance-loop closure was previously silent — operators could
   not tell how often the summarizer was being asked to digest
   assistant turns that still carry [STATE] markers (the very
   condition PR #7647 closed at the prompt-injection layer).
   Closes the silent gap noted in
   .tmp/memory-compacting-analysis.html (summarizer STATE scrub
   visibility). *)
