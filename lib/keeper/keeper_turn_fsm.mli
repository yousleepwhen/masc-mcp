(** Typed FSM vocabulary for keeper turn lifecycle.

    Step 4a of the bloodflow restoration plan introduces the
    state / failure / cancel-reason ADTs only.  The transition
    function with telemetry emission is left to a follow-up
    stack so the type surface lands additively first.

    precondition on every forward action) and [SupervisorRequestsStop]
    requires [stop_signaled] to transition from [false] to [true]
    (matching the TLA+ [~stop_signaled /\ stop_signaled'] guard).

    transitions have no stop-signal guard, and [SupervisorRequestsStop]
    falls back to the same-state heuristic. *)

(** Emit a structured FSM transition log line.

    Step 4b kicks off the call-site adoption stack: this is an
    observe-only secondary emit alongside the existing receipt path.  The
    runtime branch shape is unchanged; the transition is both logged and
    appended to [Keeper_transition_audit] as a turn-FSM WAL row via the
    [turn_id] correlator wired in Step 0a (#11154 / #11156 / #11159), so an
    operator can see the state the runtime *intended* without waiting for the
    final receipt JSON.

    The line format is
    [\[fsm:transition\] <prev> -> <state> action=<action> stop_before=.. stop_after=..];
    a missing [?prev] renders as ["-"].  Stop-signal fields are
    emitted only when [?ctx] is provided.  Stable for operator
    regex parsing and pinned by the [test_keeper_turn_fsm_emit]
    sentinel so a future signature drift fails the build. *)
