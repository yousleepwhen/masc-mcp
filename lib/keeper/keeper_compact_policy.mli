(** Keeper_compact_policy — compaction gate and strategy application.

    Decides whether compaction should run based on ratio/message/token
    gates and cooldown, then applies OAS strategies + persona fold.

    emergency, bypassing the continuity-reflection cooldown gate.

    to default with warn). Read once at module init; restart required
    to change. Effective value is exported as Prometheus gauge
    {!Keeper_metrics.(to_string EmergencyCompactRatioThreshold)}. *)
