(** Event-dispatch transition validators.

    Extracted from keeper_registry.ml as part of the godfile decomp
    campaign. Two side-effect wrappers shared by RFC-0002 Event
    Dispatch and RFC-0072 Phase 6 (compaction matrix). Pure on top of
    [Keeper_registry_types] resolvers / state machine helpers — no
    registry state read or written.

    Companion to [Keeper_registry_fsm_validators] (cascade /
    turn_phase) which carries the GADT-resolver wrappers. *)

(* RFC-0072 Phase 6: the 3×3 compaction matrix dispatched as an exhaustive
   match — the 3 valid pairs (incl. idempotent self-loops) return [()], the
   3 forbidden pairs raise the typed [Compaction_transition_violation]
   (replacing the prior bare [assert], whose [Assert_failure] carried no
   labels).  Still wrapped in [Keeper_fsm_guard_runtime.wrap_unit] so
   [metric_fsm_guard_violation] (action=compaction_transition, stage=guard)
   fires on a forbidden pair; the match stays exhaustive so adding a
   [compaction_stage] variant triggers Warning 8 here.  No
   [Compaction_transition] GADT / [resolve_*] helper: with 3 states and a
   single consumer the resolver indirection would be premature. *)
