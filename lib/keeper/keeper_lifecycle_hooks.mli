(** Keeper Lifecycle Cleanup Hooks (RFC-0036 Phase A.1).

    Foundation for the lifecycle_cleanup_hook plumbing described in
    [docs/rfc/RFC-0036-multi-keeper-docker-orchestration.md].

    The two production call sites are:
    - [Keeper_registry.dispatch_event_with_audit] fires [Phase_transition]
      after the state machine accepts a phase change and before the
      registry write commits.
    - [Keeper_supervisor.sweep_and_recover] fires [Tombstone_reaped] after
      a dead-keeper unregister succeeds (see [Keeper_lifecycle_hooks.run]
      invocation in keeper_supervisor.ml).

    Phase B/C uses the same registration API to attach the
    [Docker_runtime] bridge.

    Contract:
    - Hooks are best-effort, synchronous, and exception-safe. The runner
      logs and swallows exceptions so a single misbehaving hook cannot
      block supervisor work or other hooks.
    - Hook registration is process-global. Order of execution is the
      order of registration. There is no unregister API by design — once
      a subsystem opts in, it stays in for the process lifetime.
    - Hook list is backed by [Atomic.t] for lock-free read on the
      supervisor hot path.

    Future extensions (Phase A.2+): structured event payload
    (subprocess pid set, owner keeper config) once call sites are wired. *)

(** Lifecycle event the hook is invoked with. *)
type event =
  | Phase_transition of {
      from_phase : Keeper_state_machine.phase;
      to_phase   : Keeper_state_machine.phase;
    }
      (** Fired from [Keeper_registry.dispatch_event_with_audit] for real
          phase changes before the registry write commits. Hooks observe
          the intent of the transition; they cannot veto. *)
  | Tombstone_reaped
      (** Fired by [Keeper_supervisor.cleanup_dead_tombstone] after the
          registry unregister completes. The keeper is fully gone from
          in-process state at this point. *)

(** Hook callback. *)
type hook = keeper_id:string -> event -> unit

(** Register a cleanup hook. Idempotency is the caller's responsibility
    — calling twice with the same closure registers it twice. *)
val register : hook -> unit

(** Run every registered hook with the given event. Non-cancellation
    exceptions raised from a hook are caught, counted via
    [metric_keeper_lifecycle_callback_failures], and logged via
    [Log.Server.warn]. When [base_dir] and [meta] are supplied, the
    failure also writes a durable telemetry coverage-gap row so the
    best-effort hook contract is visible outside process-local logs.
    [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled] is re-raised to preserve cooperative
    cancellation. *)
val run :
  ?base_dir:string ->
  ?meta:Keeper_types.keeper_meta ->
  keeper_id:string ->
  event ->
  unit

(** Number of currently registered hooks. Useful for tests. *)
val registered_count : unit -> int

(** Clear all registered hooks. Test-only escape hatch. Production
    code should never call this. *)
val reset_for_testing : unit -> unit
