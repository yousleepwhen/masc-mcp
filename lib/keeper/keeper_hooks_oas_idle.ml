(** Pure decision logic for the on_idle hook.  Testable without Coord.config.

    Graduated response to repeated tool calls uses the configured
    [Env_config_keeper.KeeperKeepalive.idle_skip_threshold]:
    - For idle counts below [skip_at - 1]: gentle nudge suggesting alternatives
    - For idle counts at [skip_at - 1]: final warning (stronger nudge)
      suggesting [stay_silent]
    - For idle counts at or above [skip_at]: Skip (end this turn, but the
      heartbeat loop will retry next cycle)

    The [~allowed_tools] parameter enables concrete alternative suggestions
    instead of generic "try a different tool" messages. This is the
    deterministic envelope providing structured options for the
    non-deterministic LLM to choose from.

    Skip is not death. The keeper's heartbeat loop will schedule a new
    turn on the next cycle with fresh context. The key insight is that
    burning more tokens on a stuck LLM is worse than retrying later. *)
