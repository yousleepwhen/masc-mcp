(** Keeper_tool_deterministic_error — classify a keeper tool's failure
    payload as deterministic (replaying with the same arguments will
    fail the same way) versus unclassified (transient errors and shell
    exit-nonzero results stay outside this surface).

    Use in [Keeper_tools_oas] failure branch to short-circuit the
    per-tool consecutive-failure counter at the first attempt. Counters
    still exist for transient errors; only deterministic policy/shape
    blocks bypass the 1/3 -> 2/3 -> 3/3 emit cycle.

    Background — MASC/OAS Error-Warn Reduction Goal 2026-05-18, P2
    reducer ("Stop retry loops for blocked command shapes"). Three
    Execute invocations with identical args and identical error payloads
    were generating duplicate ERROR log lines at 1/3, 2/3 and 3/3. The
    retry itself is driven by the LLM re-issuing the same tool call after
    seeing an error — the dedicated retry envelope
    (Agent_sdk.Tool_retry_policy) is configured with
    retry_on_recoverable_tool_error=false, so this module covers the
    LLM-driven retry loop specifically. *)

(** Closed enumeration of deterministic error reasons. Adding a new
    variant requires updating both [classify] (input -> variant) and
    [to_string] (variant -> stable telemetry label). Exhaustive match
    is enforced by [-strict-sequence] in the [dune] config. *)

  | Structured_tool_required
      (** Raw shell rejected because a structured visible tool/native workflow is required. *)
  | Workflow_rejection_blocked
      (** typed workflow_rejection failure class — handled by a
          separate counter in [Keeper_tools_oas]. It is considered
          deterministic only when the payload explicitly carries
          [error_class="deterministic"] and [recoverable=false]. *)

      (** git process precondition failed. Typed shell producers may
          emit this for git exit 128 from structured command
          classification plus process status; the deterministic
          classifier intentionally does not re-parse stderr/output to
          split missing refs from command usage. *)

(** Classify a raw tool-result JSON payload (as returned by
    [Agent_tool_dispatch_runtime]) into a [deterministic_reason] only when the
    payload carries an explicit typed marker: [deterministic_retry],
    deterministic workflow-rejection fields, a typed path-check
    reason. Returns
    [None] for transient errors, shell exit-nonzero, retryability-only
    payloads, plain [error] strings, network/timeout failures, and
    any payload that fails to parse.

    There is no [error] string fallback and no [_ ->] catch-all that
    admits new prefixes silently. Producers that know same-argument
    retry cannot succeed, including typed shell producers handling git
    process failures, must emit [deterministic_retry_fields]. *)

    [error] string fallbacks. *)
