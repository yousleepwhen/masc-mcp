(** Keeper lifecycle phase variant + bijection helpers.

    SSOT for the 13-state lifecycle phase enum referenced by the
    [Keeper_state_machine] FSM, dashboard UI, persona audits, and
    operator-facing keeper status surfaces. Verbatim extract from the
    head of [Keeper_state_machine]; the parent retains a transparent
    variant alias so existing exhaustive matches at ~109 call sites
    continue to type-check unchanged.

    Pure variant + total bijection (modulo unknown-string -> None on
    parse). No FSM transitions or entry actions live here — those
    stay in the parent because they depend on [conditions] / [event]
    types still under iteration. *)
