(** SSE broadcast helpers for keeper lifecycle events.

    Extracted from keeper_registry.ml (lines 610-652) as part of the
    godfile decomp campaign. Two pure side-effect wrappers around
    [Sse.broadcast] / [Sse.broadcast_presence] with Prometheus counter
    + log on failure. No registry state touched. *)

    (* P2 silent-failure fix: previously this discarded the exception
         silently, hiding the case where the SSE broadcast pipe is dead
         (subscriber cleanup race, transport tear-down).  Operators
         investigating "dashboard stopped updating" had no signal that
         the broadcast itself was failing.  PR-C (#11075) added a
         counter on the SSE side, but only for per-client failures
         inside broadcast_impl — exceptions thrown out of
         Sse.broadcast itself bypass that counter.  Logging here
         makes the exception visible at the call site. *)
