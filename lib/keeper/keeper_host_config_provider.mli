(** Keeper repo CLI credential provider.

    Resolves a keeper through [keeper_repo_mappings.toml] and the credential
    store.  Missing or unreadable mappings fail closed; legacy inference from
    keeper profile [repo_cli_identity] or the MASC-owned [root] bundle is no
    longer a runtime fallback.  It mounts only files from the selected
    credential bundle read-only into the dispatch container and composes
    container-local forge/Git environment variables.  Operator ambient credentials
    ([GH_TOKEN], [GITHUB_TOKEN], [~/.config/gh], [~/.ssh], keychain probes) are
    outside this contract.

    [finalize] and [tear_down] are noops here — the RO mount lifetime is
    the docker [run]. *)
