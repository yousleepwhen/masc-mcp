(** Structured per-turn world snapshot consumed by
    [classify_actionable_signal]. This is intentionally smaller than
    {!Keeper_world_observation.world_observation}: it carries only the
    signals needed by the required-tool contract gate. *)

      (** Count of fresh board entries the keeper has not yet
          processed. Mirrors the count rendered after
          ["### Board Activity"]. *)
}

(** Project the full keeper heartbeat observation into the compact contract
    snapshot. The task count uses [claimable_task_count], not global backlog
    size, so keepers without a matching claim surface do not get forced into
    an impossible required-tool contract. *)

(** [classify_actionable_signal o] returns the most-specific
    actionable signal observed in [o], following the precedence
    [unclaimed_tasks > board_activity].

    The precedence reflects the action ladder a keeper should
    descend: a claimable task is the highest-leverage move; engaging
    with board activity is next.

    Boolean-compatible:
    [classify_actionable_signal o <> No_actionable_signal]
    is the structured equivalent of a required actionable context. *)
val classify_actionable_signal : world_observation -> actionable_signal

(** Like [classify_actionable_signal], but skips a candidate signal when
    the active tool surface has no tool capable of acting on that signal.

    This preserves the documented precedence while avoiding unwinnable
    contract violations. Example: if unclaimed tasks exist but the keeper
    cannot see a claim tool, board activity can still become the selected
    actionable signal when board tools are visible. *)
val classify_actionable_signal_for_tools :

(** [requires_tool_support_for_allowed_tools ~allowed_tool_names o] is true
    when [o] carries an actionable signal that can be satisfied by at least
    one tool in [allowed_tool_names]. Use this before provider routing so the
    same structured signal that later enforces the completion contract also
    selects a provider capable of exposing keeper tools. *)

    Provided so callers comparing the structured signal against the
    legacy boolean can do so without a manual pattern match. *)
