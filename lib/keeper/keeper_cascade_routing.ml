(** State-aware cascade profile selection.

    Maps keeper phase to an effective cascade profile name.
    Pure function — mirrors TLA+ KeeperCoreTriad.SelectCascade action.
    The live keeper-turn hot path phase-gates non-executable phases before
    provider dispatch; those branches are retained for diagnostics/spec parity
    and must not imply that a new provider turn will run while paused,
    draining, overflowed, compacting, or handing off.
