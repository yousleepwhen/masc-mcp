(** Runtime safety wrapper for [@@fsm_guard]-bearing identity helpers.

    Cycle 43 / Tier I3 follow-up to the smoke test at
    [keeper_turn_fsm.ml:118] (PR #11377 era). The PPX
    [@@fsm_guard "<bool-expr>"] injects [assert (<bool-expr>);] into
    the function body.

    [wrap_unit] runs a [unit -> unit] thunk under that contract: any
    exception escaping the thunk (legacy [Assert_failure] from PPX-injected
    asserts, legacy [Invalid_argument] from string-message validators, or
    the typed [Keeper_registry.Cascade_transition_violation] /
    [Turn_phase_transition_violation] as of RFC-0072 Phase 5) bumps the
    [Prometheus.metric_fsm_guard_violation] counter labelled with
    [action] / [stage], and is re-raised unchanged.  FSM contract
    violations are fail-closed in production and tests;
    [MASC_FSM_GUARD_ASSERT] is no longer a runtime soft-mode escape hatch.
    The catch is widened to all exceptions (rather than naming the typed
    ones) because [Keeper_registry] already depends on this module, so a
    back-reference would form a dependency cycle.

    The thunk is expected to call an identity helper of return type
    [unit] (a function whose only purpose is to carry the
    [@@fsm_guard] attribute). *)
