(** Stale-turn watchdog — standalone fiber for keeper liveness detection.

    Extracted from [Keeper_supervisor] to avoid circular dependency with
    [Keeper_keepalive]. Both modules call [fork_stale_watchdog] through
    this shared implementation.

    Two stall detection modes:
    1. Idle stall: [last_turn_ts] older than 300s while [Running].
    2. Failure loop: [consecutive_noop_count >= 3] — catches keepers in
       LLM timeout loops where [last_turn_ts] stays fresh because each
       failed turn updates it.

    On detection, sets [fiber_stop] and emits a stale broadcast so the
    supervisor's [sweep_and_recover] can restart the keeper.

    @since PR #10670 — extracted from Keeper_supervisor. *)

(* Process-global termination history per keeper.  Survives keeper
   unregister/re-register because the watchdog module's state lives
   for the server process lifetime.  Each entry records the
   timestamps of recent stale terminations within a sliding window;
   when the count exceeds [escalation_threshold] we emit a loud
   warn line and a Prometheus counter so operators see the death
   spiral pattern (#10765 — 116 stale terminations / 24h, single
   keeper hit 13× with no escalation under the previous design).

   This is observability only — we still let the supervisor restart
   the keeper.  Phase 2 (deciding whether to auto-pause) is left
   for a follow-up PR with measurement evidence in hand. *)

(* #10765 phase 2: fleet-wide batch termination detection.

   Each keeper runs its watchdog as an independent fiber, so the
   per-keeper [record_stale_termination] above never sees the
   cross-keeper pattern.  Issue evidence: 8 keepers terminated
   within the same second at 12:54:13Z (analyst, executor,
   issue_king, janitor, masc-improver, nick0cave, ollama-local,
   qa-king).  That shape is a *systemic* signal — typically cascade
   dead (#10474), provider auth failure, or fd exhaustion (#10745) —
   not 8 independent stuck fibers.  The supervisor will keep
   restarting each one individually unless an operator notices.

   Track recent terminations across all keepers in a small bounded
   window.  When the number of distinct keepers in the window
   reaches the threshold we emit a fleet-tier ERROR pointing at the
   systemic root-cause issue list, plus a Prometheus counter.  No
   state-machine change: the per-keeper restart still proceeds.  The
   point is to make the batch event visible at all. *)
