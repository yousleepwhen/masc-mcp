(** Stale-turn watchdog — standalone fiber for keeper liveness detection.

    Extracted from [Keeper_supervisor] to avoid circular dependency with
    [Keeper_keepalive]. Both modules call [fork_stale_watchdog] through
    this shared implementation.

    Two stall detection modes:
    1. Idle stall: [last_turn_ts] older than 300s while [Running].
    2. Failure loop: [consecutive_noop_count >= 3] — catches keepers in
       LLM timeout loops where [last_turn_ts] stays fresh because each
       failed turn updates it.

    On detection, sets [fiber_stop] and emits a stale broadcast so the
    supervisor's [sweep_and_recover] can restart the keeper.

    @since PR #10670 — extracted from Keeper_supervisor. *)
