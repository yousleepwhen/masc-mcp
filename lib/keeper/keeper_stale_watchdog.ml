(** Stale-turn watchdog — standalone fiber for keeper liveness detection.

    Extracted from [Keeper_supervisor] to avoid circular dependency with
    [Keeper_keepalive]. Both modules call [fork_stale_watchdog] through
    this shared implementation.

    Four stall detection modes — see {!Keeper_registry.stale_kill_class}:
    1. [Idle_turn]: [last_turn_ts] older than the idle threshold while
       the keeper phase is [Running] but no [current_turn_observation]
       is recorded, with no recent keepalive skip verdict proving the
       fiber is still evaluating work.
    2. [In_turn_hung]: a turn started ([current_turn_observation = Some])
       and ran past [timeout_threshold] seconds — covers the
       "Orphaned Streaming" pattern (executor FSM analysis §4 I2:
       [in_turn_age > grace_period → in_turn_stale]).
    3. [Mid_turn_no_progress]: a turn is still within the outer turn
       cap, but streaming/tool progress has gone silent.
    4. [Noop_failure_loop]: turns kept firing but produced no tool
       calls; the keepalive's [consecutive_noop_count] reached the
       watchdog threshold — catches keepers in LLM timeout loops where
       [last_turn_ts] stays fresh because each failed turn updates it.

    On detection, sets [fiber_stop] and emits a stale broadcast so the
    supervisor's [sweep_and_recover] can restart the keeper.

    @since PR #10670 — extracted from Keeper_supervisor. *)

(* Spec navigation (OCaml -> TLA+) — plan §19 anchor pattern.  Sibling
   to PR 11618 (Cycle 35, keeper_execution_receipt.ml).  Authoritative
   spec mirror is
   specs/keeper-state-machine/OperatorPauseBroadcast.tla.

   Spec line 20-21 cite "lib/keeper/keeper_supervisor.ml: stale
   watchdog fiber forks under ctx.sw and calls
   emit_stale_keeper_broadcast".  That citation pre-dates PR 10670
   which extracted this module from Keeper_supervisor to break a
   circular dependency.  After the extraction:

     keeper_supervisor.ml line ~118    fork_stale_watchdog wrapper
                                       (re-exports the function below)
     keeper_stale_watchdog.ml          actual fiber logic + emit
                                       (this file)
     keeper_execution_receipt.ml       emit_stale_keeper_broadcast
                                       definition (called at line 287
                                       of this file)

   Spec citation drift: the spec module string still says
   "keeper_supervisor.ml" but the true post-extraction location of
   the watchdog logic is here.  Spec-side cleanup is deferred — when
   the spec is next regenerated it should point at this module
   directly.

   Spec semantics modelled (TLA+ -> OCaml):
     phase = StaleRunning      reached when this watchdog detects a
                               stall (idle or failure-loop) and sets
                               fiber_stop.
     OperatorBroadcast emit    line 287 below calls
                               Keeper_execution_receipt.emit_stale_keeper_broadcast
                               unconditionally on detection (inside a
                               try block — clean Spec model).
     Eventually-emit liveness  satisfied because every detection path
                               feeds into the same emit call;
                               last_broadcast_ts (line 99) only
                               throttles repeated emissions, it does
                               not silently skip.

   Bug model the spec catches: a refactor that wrapped the line 287
   emit in a conditional that could silently skip would re-create
   the original fleet-stall regression class.  The spec's bug-action
   would silently drop emits and violate the leads-to property. *)

(* Cycle 50 observability: kill-class-dimensioned counter.

   The pre-existing [masc_keeper_stale_termination_total] counter has
   only the [keeper] label, so a dashboard cannot attribute kills to
   the typed [stale_kill_class] root cause without re-parsing the
   reason_desc text.  PR #11292 already typed the class as
   [Keeper_registry.stale_kill_class] (idle_turn / in_turn_hung /
   noop_failure_loop); this PR surfaces that class as a Prometheus
   label so operators can chart "which root cause is dominant?".

   The existing termination counter is preserved unchanged (no label
   changes, no removal) so existing dashboards / alerts continue to
   work.  This counter is purely additive. *)

(* #10765 phase 2: fleet-wide batch termination detection.

   Each keeper runs its watchdog as an independent fiber, so the
   per-keeper [record_stale_termination] above never sees the
   cross-keeper pattern.  Issue evidence: 8 keepers terminated
   within the same second at 12:54:13Z (analyst, executor,
   issue_king, janitor, masc-improver, nick0cave, ollama-local,
   qa-king).  That shape is a *systemic* signal, not 8 independent
   stuck fibers.  The supervisor will keep restarting each one
   individually unless an operator notices.

   Track recent terminations across all keepers in a small bounded
   window.  When the number of distinct keepers in the window reaches
   the threshold we emit a fleet-tier WARN and a Prometheus counter
   labelled by the low-cardinality [batch_root_cause].

   This is deliberately observation-only.  A fleet-wide stale burst is a
   useful signal for operators and provider/cascade health, but it is not
   itself a keeper terminal reason.  Keepers retain their per-keeper
   watchdog reason so the supervisor can apply the normal restart/dead
   budget instead of amplifying one shared upstream hiccup into a durable
   fleet pause. *)
