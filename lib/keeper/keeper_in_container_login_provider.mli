    Both inputs are SHA-256-hashed and compared as fixed-length hex
    strings.  Matching tokens indicate a confused-deputy scenario where
    the keeper would act as the operator — the gate prevents this by
    returning [Error Invalid_token].

    Callers should read the keeper token from the credential bundle
    and the operator token from the process environment ([GH_TOKEN],
    [GITHUB_TOKEN]) before passing them here. *)
