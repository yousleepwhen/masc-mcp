(* Keeper state-machine -> Mermaid stateDiagram-v2 rendering.

   Used by the dashboard FSM diagnostic panel. Pure mapping over the
   [Keeper_state_machine.phase] type - no I/O, no shared state.

   Extracted from [Keeper_state_machine] (godfile decomp). Note: no
   reverse alias in [Keeper_state_machine] - external callers reference
   this module directly to avoid the wrapped-library import cycle
   recorded in memory/feedback. *)
