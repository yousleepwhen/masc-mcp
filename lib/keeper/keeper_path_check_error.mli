(** Closed sum type for keeper path-check errors emitted by
    [worker_dev_tools] path validators.

    Before this module, path containment errors were rendered as ad-hoc
    [Printf.sprintf] strings at multiple emit sites and classified
    downstream via [String_util.contains_substring] grep — the
    classifier anti-pattern called out in #9521 and tracked as
    Workaround Rejection Bar signature #2 (string/substring classifier
    boosted instead of removed).

    Goal:
    - One typed variant per emit category (exhaustive [match] forces
      new variants to update all callers at compile time).
    - Stable lowercase [prefix_token] per variant — kept identical to
      the prior raw-string prefixes so downstream observers
      (dashboard tool-quality, log aggregators) keep working without
      a behaviour change in this PR.
    - [parse_prefix] is a typed lookup, not substring grep; circuit
      breaker classification consumes it directly. *)

    so downstream tools that match on these messages keep their

val message_prefix : t -> string

    (e.g. dashboard tool-quality). Always a strict prefix of the
    lowercase form of [to_message]. *)

val parse_prefix : string -> t option
(** Inverse of [to_message] for the variant tag only — payload fields
    are left empty / [None] since the typed module is intended for
    classification, not full message reconstruction. *)
