     Workflow rejection is the most specific (already routed to a
     dedicated counter in [Keeper_tools_oas]). Once observed, it must
     not fall through to [error] string fallbacks; only explicit
     deterministic workflow markers may short-circuit retry. Path
     checks have their own typed surface. Generic [error] codes and
     retryability-only fields are observational metadata, not a
     deterministic reason. Git process failures must be marked by
     their typed producer instead of re-parsed from stderr here. *)
