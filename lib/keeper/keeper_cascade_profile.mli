(** Typed keeper cascade compatibility inventory and legacy alias normalization.

    Keepers historically used stringly-typed cascade names in TOML, runtime
    metadata, telemetry labels, and cascade lookups. This module is the SSOT
    for the typed compatibility inventory used by exhaustive matches and the
    legacy aliases that must continue to resolve.

    The active runtime catalog is schema-driven via
    {!Cascade_config_loader.load_catalog} / {!Cascade_catalog_runtime}; do not
    treat this module's variant inventory as the live repo or per-user catalog.
 *)

(** Typed compatibility inventory for keeper-facing cascade labels.

    Adding a new inventory entry is a compile-time event: add a variant here
    and every exhaustive [match] across the codebase flags the consumer sites
    that need to handle it. This inventory is intentionally wider than the
    checked-in repo seed in [config/cascade.toml]/[config/cascade.json]:
    compatibility names may remain typed here even when they are absent from
    the active catalog.

    Personal/playground-only cascades must NOT be added here — they live in
    [$MASC_BASE_PATH/.masc/playground/.../cascade.json].

val all : t list
(** [all] is exhaustive: every variant constructor of {!t} appears
    exactly once. Consumers that need to enumerate profiles should
    derive from this rather than maintaining a parallel list. *)

(** Canonical lowercase-snake-case name, matching the
    [<name>_models]/[<name>_temperature]/[<name>_max_tokens] convention
    in [config/cascade.json]. *)

val of_string_opt : string -> t option
(** Parse a raw cascade name into the variant. Handles legacy aliases
    ([oas-keeper_unified], [coding_first], [keeper_turn], [keeper_reply])
    by collapsing them to their canonical variant. Returns [None] for
    unknown names — use {!canonical} when you want a forced fallback. *)

val typed_inventory_names : string list
(** [typed_inventory_names = List.map to_string all]. This is the typed
    compatibility inventory, not the active runtime catalog. Use
    {!catalog_names} / {!keeper_catalog_names} for live catalog views. *)

val catalog_names : ?config_path:string -> unit -> string list
(** Live profile catalog discovered from the active [cascade.json].
    Discovery is delegated to {!Cascade_config_loader.load_catalog}, so
    profiles are surfaced from recognized cascade schema keys
    (for example [{name}_models], [{name}_temperature],
    [{name}_strategy], ...). When the file cannot be read, returns [[]]
    rather than synthesizing a hardcoded catalog. *)

val keeper_catalog_names : ?config_path:string -> unit -> string list
(** Assignable live profile names from {!catalog_names}, filtered by
    explicit [{name}_keeper_assignable = false] metadata in
    [cascade.json]. Read failures return [[]]. *)

val system_catalog_names : ?config_path:string -> unit -> string list
(** Live system-only profile names present in [cascade.json], selected
    by explicit [{name}_keeper_assignable = false] metadata. Read
    failures return [[]]. *)

val is_system_only_cascade : string -> bool
(** Exact-name membership check against the active config's
    {!system_catalog_names}. *)

val canonicalize_with_catalog : catalog:string list -> string -> string
(** Like {!canonicalize}, but resolves dynamic profiles against an explicit
    live catalog instead of the active config path. Intended for tests and
    server-side validation flows that already loaded the catalog. *)

val resolve_live_with_catalog : catalog:string list -> string -> string
(** Resolves a keeper-declared cascade against an explicit live catalog.

    Semantics:
    - blank/whitespace -> {!default_name}
    - known legacy alias -> canonical known name, but only if present in [catalog]
    - exact dynamic/live profile name -> preserved when present in [catalog]
    - any name absent from [catalog] -> {!default_name}

    Unlike {!canonicalize_with_catalog}, this treats compile-time built-in
    names that are no longer active in the runtime catalog as drift and
    falls back to {!default_name}. Use this at runtime read surfaces that
    need to mirror the active catalog rather than the variant inventory. *)

val resolve_live : ?config_path:string -> string -> string
(** Like {!resolve_live_with_catalog}, but reads the active catalog from the
    resolved cascade config path. *)

val canonicalize : string -> string
(** [canonicalize raw = to_string (canonical raw)]. Existing
    string-based call sites continue to work; legacy aliases collapse to
    their canonical built-in name, live catalog names pass through, and
    unknown values fall back to {!default_name}. *)

val normalize_declared_name : string -> string
(** Normalizes only the keeper-side implicit default and legacy aliases.

    Semantics:
    - blank/whitespace -> {!default_name}
    - known legacy alias -> canonical known name
    - unknown nonblank name -> preserved (trimmed)

    This lets runtime-authoritative catalogs accept dynamic profile names
    without using the compile-time variant inventory as the source of truth. *)
