(** Fork a stale-turn watchdog fiber for the given keeper.

    Two detection modes:
    - Idle stall: [last_turn_ts] older than 300s while [Running].
    - Failure loop: [consecutive_noop_count >= 3] — catches keepers in
      LLM timeout loops where [last_turn_ts] stays fresh.

    On detection, sets [fiber_stop] and emits a stale broadcast. The
    supervisor's [sweep_and_recover] picks up the stopped fiber and
    restarts with exponential backoff. *)
