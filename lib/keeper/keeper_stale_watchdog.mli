    Four detection modes — see {!Keeper_registry.stale_kill_class}:
    - [Idle_turn]: [last_turn_ts] older than the idle threshold while
      the keeper phase is [Running] but no [current_turn_observation]
      is recorded.
    - [In_turn_hung]: a turn started ([current_turn_observation = Some])
      and ran past [timeout_threshold] seconds — covers the
      "Orphaned Streaming" pattern described in the executor FSM
      analysis (TLA+ I2: [in_turn_age > grace_period → in_turn_stale]).
    - [Mid_turn_no_progress]: a turn is still within the outer active-turn
      cap, but its progress timestamp is stale, catching no-first-token and
      inter-chunk-idle stalls without shortening the total turn budget.
    - [Noop_failure_loop]: turns kept firing but produced no tool
      calls; the keepalive's [consecutive_noop_count] reached the
      watchdog threshold — catches keepers in LLM timeout loops where
      [last_turn_ts] stays fresh because each failed turn updates it.

    Detection class is exposed on the
    [masc_keeper_stale_termination_by_class] Prometheus counter for
    per-class root-cause attribution.

    On detection, sets [fiber_stop] and emits a stale broadcast. The
    supervisor's [sweep_and_recover] picks up the stopped fiber and restarts
    with exponential backoff, unless a per-keeper stale storm routes the keeper
    to auto-pause/backoff first. Fleet batch detection is observation-only. *)
