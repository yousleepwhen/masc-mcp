(** Keeper_runtime_config — load startup keeper env seeding from
    [<resolved config root>/keeper_runtime.toml].

    Per-base-path config for keeper turn budgets, semaphore timeouts, and
    other runtime parameters that previously lived only in environment
    variables.  Closes the architectural gap where tools/personas/cascade
    are per-base-path but keeper runtime tuning was global.

    Precedence (highest first):
      1. Process env var (caller override, e.g. CI/test)
      2. TOML value from [<resolved config root>/keeper_runtime.toml]
      3. Hardcoded default in [Env_config_keeper.KeeperKeepalive].

    Legacy env names that are still honored at runtime also count as
    process env overrides for their canonical TOML key.

    The TOML loader runs at server startup, before any module that reads
    these env vars initializes. It stores boot defaults in a process-local
    override table so existing config readers can resolve TOML-backed values
    without mutating the parent environment. This file is startup-only today;
    there is no hot-reload path.

    @since 0.7.1 *)

(** Load TOML from [<resolved config root>/keeper_runtime.toml] and
    record any overrides in the process-local boot override store.

    The resolved config root honors [MASC_CONFIG_DIR] when set; otherwise it
    follows the standard base-path/home fallback chain.

    Process-level env vars set by the caller take precedence — the TOML
    value is only applied when the env var is unset. This preserves the
    CI/test workflow of overriding via env.

    Returns [Ok num_overrides] (count of TOML keys actually applied,
    excluding those preempted by existing env vars), or [Error msg] on
    parse failure.  Missing file is not an error: returns [Ok 0]. *)
val load_and_apply : base_path:string -> (int, string) result

(** Pure resolution: parse TOML and determine which env vars would be
    overridden, without mutating the process-local boot override store.

    [~env_lookup] defaults to [Env_config_core.raw_value_opt]; tests inject a fake env
    to avoid global process env dependency.

    Returns [(count, overrides)] where [overrides] is
    [(env_name, value) list]. *)
