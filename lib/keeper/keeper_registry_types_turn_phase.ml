(** Keeper_registry_types_turn_phase — turn_phase FSM types and transitions.

    Extracted from [Keeper_registry_types] (996 LoC). Pure type definitions
    and functions for the turn_phase GADT, witnesses, transition matrix,
    spec violation types, and resolver.

(** Pure control-flow signal for immediate fiber termination (RFC-0002).
