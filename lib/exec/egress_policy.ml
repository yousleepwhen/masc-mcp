(** P12 — Network egress policy for Docker sandbox execution.

    Pure module: domain allowlist loading, matching, and structured
    error generation.  No I/O beyond file reading; no knowledge of
    Docker or keeper internals.

    Policy source: [egress.json] in the keeper's config directory.
    Empty, missing, unreadable, or invalid policy = fail closed for
    commands with extracted outbound domains.
    Wildcard suffix: ["*.github.com"] matches ["api.github.com"]. *)

  allowed : string list;
  source : string;
}

  let normalized =
    List.map (fun d ->
      String.trim (String.lowercase_ascii d)
    ) domains
  in
  { allowed = normalized; source }

    - Exact match after lowercasing
    - Wildcard prefix ["*.x.com"] matches ["sub.x.com"] and ["x.com"] *)

    If the policy has no allowed domains, commands with extracted outbound
    domains are blocked. Commands without extracted domains are allowed.

(** Format a blocked result as a structured JSON string.

    [expected_policy_path] is the on-disk path the caller resolved for
    this keeper's [egress.json].  When supplied, the JSON includes
    [expected_policy_path] plus a humanish [reason] aimed at the LLM
    consumer — empty allowlist points operator at "seed this file",
    non-empty-but-unmatched allowlist points at "extend this file".

    The payload always carries [failure_class="policy_rejection"] so
    downstream retry/log classification does not have to infer policy
    semantics from the [error] string. *)
