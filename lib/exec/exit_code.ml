(** P13 — Exit code semantic interpretation.

    Pure module: maps [Unix.process_status] to human/LLM-readable
    meanings so agents can self-correct without blind retry loops.

    Signal numbers follow POSIX.  128+N convention covers cases
    where the shell reports signal death as an exit code. *)
