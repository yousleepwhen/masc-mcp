(** Approval_policy_typed — GADT-based policy decision.

    Thin wrapper around [Approval_policy.decide]: the GADT gives us a
    total capability extractor, but the rule cascade (destructive-git
    check, write-escape check, trust-level dispatch) is intentionally
    reused without duplication. *)
