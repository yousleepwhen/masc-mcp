(** Capability_check_typed — GADT-based capability derivation.

    Each arm reconstructs the [Shell_ir.arg list] that the untyped walker
    would have produced, then wraps it in [Capability.Exec_program].  This
    keeps the capability model unchanged while making the walker indexed
    by the GADT.

    Env / redirect handling: typed constructors do not carry [env] or
    [redirects], so [Shell_ir_typed.of_simple] forces the [Generic]
    fallback whenever the source [simple] has either set.  That keeps
    redirect-derived [Read_path] / [Write_path] and [Env_set]
    capabilities flowing through [Capability_check.of_simple] for the
    [Generic] arm below — without this any redirect outside the
    worktree would be invisible to [Approval_policy.find_write_escape]
    on a parsed command. *)
