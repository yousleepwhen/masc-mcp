(** Exec_program — opaque classified executable name.

    The only entry point is {!of_string}.  Callers cannot mint a [t]
    from raw data, which forces every argv-like shape through one
    classification site.  [`Unknown] becomes [Privileged] so the
    approval policy treats unseen binaries as Ask by default. *)

  [ `Safe (** e.g. [ls], [cat], [pwd], [echo], [rg], [head], [tail] *)
  | `Audited (** e.g. [git], [docker], [curl], [ssh], [tar], [rsync], [make], [gh] *)
  | `Privileged
    (** e.g. [sudo], [su], [chmod], [chown], [rm], [dd], [mkfs]; also
        the fallback for names that the registry does not know. *)
  ]

(** Finer-grained classification for typed dispatch.  Callers that
    used to switch on [Exec_program.to_string bin = "git"] should switch on
    [Exec_program.kind bin] instead so a new audited bin forces a compile
    error in every dispatch site.

    The shape mirrors {!risk_class} 1:1 — [`Safe_program] for [`Safe],
    [`Privileged_program] for [`Privileged], and the audited names fan
    out into [`Git | `Docker | `Curl | `Ssh | `Other_audited]. *)

(** Closed variant of every binary the exec gate knows about.

    Each constructor maps to exactly one metadata entry in the implementation.
    Adding a new binary requires adding a constructor here AND updating the
    metadata function there; the compiler enforces completeness so no known
    binary can silently miss name/risk/kind classification. *)
