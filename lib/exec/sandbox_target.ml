(* Sandbox target abstraction for Shell_ir dispatch.

   Why this exists
   ---------------
   Prior to 2026-04-28, [Exec_dispatch.dispatch_simple] called
   [Process_eio.run_argv_with_status_split] directly. The Shell_ir record
   carried no information about *where* the command should run, so every
   parsed shell command short-circuited to a host-side fork/exec. When a
   keeper was configured for [sandbox_profile = "docker"], the keeper's
   bash dispatch path consulted [Keeper_sandbox_docker.run_docker_*]
   functions, but any command that flowed through the Shell_ir IR
   bypassed that branch entirely (defect A in the 2026-04-28 root-fix
   audit).

   This module introduces a callback-runner abstraction that lets
   Shell_ir carry the sandbox decision *as data*, while keeping the
   layering clean: [lib/exec] cannot depend on [lib/keeper], so we do
   not embed [Keeper_turn_sandbox_runtime.t] in the kind. Instead, the
   keeper layer constructs a [t] whose [runner] is a closure over its
   own runtime; [lib/exec] only sees the shape of the closure.

   Variant design (2026-05-09)
   ---------------------------
   [t] is a variant rather than a record so that the [Host] case needs
   no runner closure.  This eliminates the circular dependency
   [Sandbox_target -> Exec_gate -> Capability -> Verdict -> Shell_ir ->
   Sandbox_target] that previously forced [host ()] to call
   [Process_eio.run_argv_with_status_split] directly.  The dispatch
   path in [Exec_dispatch] now routes [Host] directly to
   [Exec_gate.run_argv_with_status_split], and [Docker] via the carried
   [runner]. *)
