    git push/commit/merge/rebase/reset/checkout -c/-C/-m/-M/branch,

(** Direct repo-hosting CLI word-list classification without IR construction.
    The current command literal is ["gh"], but the API is named for the
    Shell-IR capability boundary rather than a product-level GH helper family. *)
