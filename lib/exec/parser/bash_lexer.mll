   Unsupported shell forms still fail closed through Parsed.Too_complex
   or Parse_error.  See RFC v5 (docs/rfc/RFC-0005). *)

(* Single-quote string: literal, no escape processing, no nested
   single quote allowed (bash semantics — there is no way to embed
   a single quote inside a '...' string).  Matched content becomes
   a single WORD token so the existing grammar accepts it in any
   WORD position without change.  Spaces inside quotes are preserved
   verbatim, so arguments like 'commit message' arrive at
   [Exec_program.of_string] / args list as one element. *)
let sq_body = [^ '\'' '\n']*

(* Double-quote string: the subset treats it as a literal whose body
   excludes the metachars bash would interpret inside "..." — variable
   expansion ($FOO, ${FOO}), command substitution (`cmd`, $(cmd)), and
   embedded newlines.  Backslash stays rejected except for [\|], which
   is a common regex literal in rg/grep patterns and is still literal
   under bash double quotes.  Any other excluded char inside the body
   breaks the lex → Parse_error,
   which is the correct fail-closed behavior for the subset.  The most
   common caller shapes (rg "pattern", git commit -m "message",
   echo "hello world") have none of those chars and land as one WORD
   token, mirroring the single-quote rule's space-preservation guarantee.
   Upgrade path: later PR widens dq_body to support escape sequences by
   capturing in a sub-rule that unescapes into a Buffer. *)
