(* Post-hoc [reason_too_complex] classifier.  Runs only after the
   Menhir grammar (or lexer) has rejected the input — so the input is
   already outside the A1-PR-1 simple-command subset.  Inspects the
   raw source for the dominant shell metachar and returns the most
   specific [reason_too_complex] variant it can.

   The scan is deliberately substring-based (not quote-aware): callers
   who quote metachars through single or double quotes land on
   [Parsed.Parsed] before this path runs, so anything reaching here
   has an unquoted metachar somewhere.  False-positive precision
   matters less than differentiating between "couldn't parse at all"
   (the old [Parse_error] bucket) and "rejected because a specific
   shell feature is subset-excluded" — the latter is what the corpus
   tap aggregates to drive future grammar expansion priority.

   Order matters: multi-char markers ([<<<], [<<], [>>], [&&], [||],
   [$(], [$((], [<(], [>(]) are checked before their single-char
   prefixes.  First match wins. *)
