(** Quote-aware shell word metadata used by policy surfaces that need
    source-shape information which {!Masc_exec.Shell_ir.Lit} intentionally
    does not carry.

    This module is not an execution parser. It shares the bash-subset lexical
    boundary and returns ordered pipeline stages so path policy can make
    quote/glob/brace decisions without keeping a private tokenizer in caller
    modules. *)

val stages : string -> (word list list, error) result
(** Tokenize [source] into non-empty command stages split on unquoted [|].
    Empty stages are omitted so callers can remain fail-closed at their own
    command-shape layer while still reusing successfully recovered words for
    diagnostics and path policy. *)

val top_level_command_segments : string -> (bool * string) list
(** Split [source] on unquoted top-level [&&], [||], [;], and newlines.
    The boolean marks whether the segment is unconditionally reached from the
    left.  Single [|] is intentionally not a separator here; pipeline-aware
    callers should continue using {!stages}. *)
