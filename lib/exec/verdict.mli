(** Verdict — four-way outcome of the approval policy.

    [Trusted_argv.t] is a [private] record whose only constructor is
    [Verdict.trust], which lives in [Approval_policy].  Downstream code
    (the exec gate) therefore cannot forge a trusted argv — it can only
    receive one that the policy has produced.

    This is the single most important type in the RFC v5 refactor:
    the exec path refuses anything that is not a [Trusted_argv.t]. *)

module Trusted_argv : sig
  type t = private {
    bin : Exec_program.t;
    args : Shell_ir.arg list;
    env : (string * Shell_ir.arg) list;
    cwd : Path_scope.t option;
    redirects : Redirect_scope.t list;
  }

  val bin : t -> Exec_program.t
  val args : t -> Shell_ir.arg list
  val env : t -> (string * Shell_ir.arg) list
  val cwd : t -> Path_scope.t option
  val redirects : t -> Redirect_scope.t list
end

type confirm_token = {
  risk_class : Exec_program.risk_class;
  ttl_sec : float;
}
(** Opaque token for future HITL confirmation flow.
    The [risk_class] identifies which trust level triggered the suggestion. *)

type request = {
  caps : Capability.t list;
  summary : string;
  bin : Exec_program.t;
  raw_source : string;
}

type deny_reason =
  | Unknown_bin of string
  | Path_escape of Path_scope.t
  | Destructive_git of Git_op.t
  | Policy_deny of { rule : string }
  | Parse_too_complex of Parsed.reason_too_complex
  | Parse_failed

type t =
  | Allow of Trusted_argv.t
  | Suggest_confirm of Trusted_argv.t * confirm_token
  | Ask of request
  | Deny of { caps : Capability.t list; reason : deny_reason }
(** Four-way verdict.  [Suggest_confirm] auto-allows but marks the
    decision as "suggested for confirmation" in telemetry.  When the
    approval trust level is [Suggest], the policy produces this variant
    instead of a plain [Allow] so the gate can log the suggestion. *)

val trust :
  caps:Capability.t list ->
  Shell_ir.simple ->
  Trusted_argv.t
(** The {i only} way to mint a [Trusted_argv.t].  Intended to be called
    from [Approval_policy.decide] after a capability list has been
    approved. *)
