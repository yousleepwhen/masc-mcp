(** Post-verifier signal weights for Thompson Sampling prior updates.
    These are intentionally weaker than direct votes (1.0) because post-verifier
    verdicts are heuristic (corpus-free text checks), not human-validated.

    Rationale for specific values:
    - pass_alpha_boost (0.3): A pass is a weak positive signal — the content
      cleared automated checks, but that does not guarantee quality.
    - warn_beta_nudge (0.1): Warnings are informational, not definitive.
      Heavy penalty would over-rotate on stylistic issues.
    - fail_beta_penalty (0.5): Stronger than warn because the content was
      actively rejected, but still below 1.0 (human vote) because
      post-verifier false positives exist.

    These should be calibrated against actual agent performance data once
    Phase 0 instrumentation (RFC-0001) collects baseline metrics.
