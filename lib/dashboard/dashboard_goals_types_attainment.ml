(** Dashboard_goals_types_attainment — Stage 22 split (was inline in
    dashboard_goals_types.ml).

    Pure metric tokenizer + percent/count inference + the goal attainment
    JSON projection ([build_attainment_json] + [goal_attainment_to_json]).
    All inputs are already-loaded; no I/O.

    Depends on [Dashboard_goals_types_accessor] for the [attainment_unit]
    variant, the [tree_node] record, and [task_is_done]. Re-included by
    [Dashboard_goals_types] so the public surface is unchanged. *)

(* Token-split that respects camelCase AND acronym boundaries.

   - lower -> upper splits (so [successRate] -> [success; rate])
   - upper -> upper-followed-by-lower splits (so [APIRatio] ->
     [api; ratio]; [PRCount] -> [pr; count])
   - consecutive uppercase letters not followed by a lowercase stay
     glued (so [API] -> [api], [HTTP] -> [http])

   Without the acronym rule, common acronym-prefixed metric names
   regressed against percent inference: post-#13170 review noted
   that names like [APIRatio] / [PRCount] still missed the percent
   token even after the camelCase fix. The split point is the
   *last* uppercase letter in a run -- that is the start of the
   following lowercase word -- not every uppercase letter, so
   abbreviations stay intact. *)
