(** Dashboard_operator_judge — periodic LLM-driven room judgment loop.

    Runs as an Eio daemon fiber per [base_path]: every
    [Env_config.Operator.judge_interval_sec], it asks an operator-judge
    keeper to evaluate room health using freshly built facts, then
    caches the verdict (and "is the judge online?" status) for HTTP
    consumption.

    The internal mutable per-base-path state, lock helpers, env-knob
    accessors, prompt construction, parsing, refresh loop, and backoff
    accounting are all hidden — the public surface is [start] (daemon
    spawn) plus [runtime_status] (snapshot read). *)

(** Read-only snapshot of judge runtime state, returned by
    {!runtime_status} and serialized into operator pending-confirm
    payloads. All fields are read externally. [model_used]
    is retained for compatibility and redacted to [None] on
    public snapshots. *)
