(** Dashboard_goals_types_health — Stage 22 split (was inline in
    dashboard_goals_types.ml).

    Pure goal-phase health classification: health badges, health reason,
    approval matching, keeper assignee resolution, goal FSM state
    projection, and the operator-disposition normalizer.

    Depends on [Dashboard_goals_types_accessor] for the [tree_node]
    record + the [human_duration] helper. Re-included by
    [Dashboard_goals_types] so the public surface is unchanged. *)

let display_disposition_of_receipt_json receipt =
  (* Previously this defaulted to the literal "unknown", which then hit
     the [| "unknown" -> "Alert"/"unmapped_cascade_state"] arm below.
     That conflated two distinct producer-side failure modes:
     (1) missing [operator_disposition] field — the receipt was emitted
         without the disposition at all (producer bug);
     (2) [operator_disposition = "unknown"] — the producer explicitly
         declared the state unmapped at the cascade layer.

     Using a bracketed sentinel as the default lets the match below
     fall through to the [_ -> "Alert"/"unmapped_operator_disposition"]
     catch-all, which is the more accurate classification for case (1).
     Both cases still surface as "Alert" severity (no operator-visible
     regression in alerting), but the reason label now distinguishes
     them so the operator can chase the right producer fix. *)
