(** Dashboard_goals_types_timeline — Stage 22 split (was inline in
    dashboard_goals_types.ml).

    Pure JSON projections for the timeline lane: color helpers, task tree
    JSON, tree flatten, goal-detail keeper JSON, generic timeline event
    record + goal-event timeline normalizer, and the [build_goal_timeline]
    composition that merges task / approval / keeper / goal-event streams.

    Depends on [Dashboard_goals_types_accessor] for the [tree_node] /
    [goal_detail_keeper] records and the task / receipt / trust
    inspectors. Re-included by [Dashboard_goals_types] so the public
    surface is unchanged. *)
