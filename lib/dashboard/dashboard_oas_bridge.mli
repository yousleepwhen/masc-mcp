(** Per-call OAS telemetry collector backing the [/oas/telemetry] dashboard.

    Layer 4 collector for {b I1 Telemetry pipeline} (#11924, Phase 1, Track T1)
    of the [Meta] MASC-MCP × OAS root improvement plan (#11923).

    Per-call signals are recorded so the dashboard can derive TTFB
    distribution, throughput, cost, cache-hit ratio, and the bimodal
    hang signature (100–200s normal vs 2,000–3,000s zombie tail). The
    collector is intentionally additive — existing metric paths remain
    untouched until I7 (string elimination) and I2 (provider_error variant)
    converge into a Type Triad SSOT.

    In-process, mutex-protected ring buffer keyed by the neutral runtime
    lane. Provider/model identifiers accepted at the boundary are discarded
    before storage so MASC-side dashboard state does not retain concrete OAS
    runtime identities. The buffer caps itself at a small bounded window so
    recording is O(1) amortized and memory stays bounded regardless of emit
    volume.

    OAS workers call {!record} after each LLM turn (tool path or chat path),
    and the REST/SSE endpoints read from {!recent} and {!summary}. Each
    recorded sample is also emitted to Observer SSE sessions as an additive
    [oas_telemetry_sample] dashboard event.

    Cross-domain: guarded by [Stdlib.Mutex]. Eio fibers may call these
    functions directly; the critical section is short (queue push or fold)
    and never yields to Eio. Same lock-discipline rationale as the
    {!Dashboard_attribution} collector.

(** [sample_of_response ~provider_id ~model_id ?total_duration_ms
    ?serialization_ms response] projects an OAS [api_response] into the
    twelve-signal bridge sample.

    - [usage] fields become token, cost, and cache-hit signals.
    - [response.telemetry.ttfrc_ms] is preferred for TTFB when OAS reports
      wall-clock time-to-first-response-chunk. Otherwise positive
      [prefill_ms] / [prompt_ms] timing is used as the compatibility
      fallback.
    - [response.telemetry.request_latency_ms] is used as duration when the
      caller does not provide [total_duration_ms]. If that aggregate latency
      is missing/zero, positive [ttfrc_ms] + [predicted_ms] timing components
      are used as a non-zero duration instead, falling back to
      [prefill_ms] / [prompt_ms] plus decode timing when [ttfrc_ms] is absent.
    - native decode throughput is preferred when OAS telemetry exposes it;
      otherwise wall-clock throughput is derived from output tokens and
      duration.
    - [provider_id] and [model_id] are accepted for source compatibility but
      are not retained; returned samples carry the neutral ["runtime"] lane.
    - [serialization_ms] carries request-serialize + response-parse overhead
      measured at the adapter boundary; defaults to [0.0] when not provided.

    Missing OAS usage is represented with [usage_reported = false] and
    nullable usage-derived fields rather than synthetic zeroes. Missing
    telemetry remains nullable where the signal cannot be derived. *)
