val frame_update : string -> string
(** [frame_update payload] wraps [payload] in the Yjs sync frame envelope
    used by browser-side Y.applyUpdate consumers: two leading control
    bytes [\x00\x02] followed by the payload length encoded as a Yjs
    varint, followed by the payload itself.  Pure function — the byte
    layout is the wire contract pinned by [test_dashboard_yjs]. *)

(** [broadcast_keeper_telemetry ~keeper_name ~trace_id ~turn_index ~model_id]
    publishes a keeper Yjs telemetry update to dashboard observer sessions.
    [model_id] is accepted for legacy call sites but redacted to the neutral
    ["runtime"] lane in the payload. Delivery is synchronous and best-effort
    through the in-process SSE observer fanout; exceptions from disconnected
    observers are logged, while cancellation is propagated. *)
