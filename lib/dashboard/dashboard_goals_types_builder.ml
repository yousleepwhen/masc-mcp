(** Dashboard_goals_types_builder — Stage 22 split (was inline in
    dashboard_goals_types.ml).

    Pure builders that compose the lower-level projections into
    higher-level structures: convergence ratio, verification policy
    nodes, runtime blocker / trust fallback JSON, and the recursive
    [build_tree] that produces a [tree_node] from a [build_context]
    snapshot.

    Depends on [Dashboard_goals_types_accessor],
    [Dashboard_goals_types_health], and on
    [Keeper_status_bridge] / [Time_compat] / [Json_util] /
    [Masc_domain] for the clock + JSON helpers (no state mutation).
    Re-included by [Dashboard_goals_types] so the public surface is
    unchanged. *)
