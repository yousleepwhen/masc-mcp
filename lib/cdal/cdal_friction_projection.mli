(** Cdal_friction_projection -- Single-run friction projection from v1 evidence.

    Groups blocked attempts from mode_violations.json by (tool_name,
    violation_kind, effective_mode).  Uses only v1 fields; v2 fields
    (effect_class, required_min_mode, violated_rule_id, trace_id, turn)
    are treated as unavailable. When blocked attempts exist, the projection
    also checks [evidence/effects.json] for Mode_enforcer source-path evidence
    and emits a blocking completeness gap if that call-site evidence is absent.

(** [project_single_run ~store ?completeness_gaps ?tripwire_threshold proof]
    reads [mode_violations.json], parses v1 violation records, groups by
    [(tool_name, violation_kind, effective_mode)], derives tool counts and
    evidence gap groups, and fires review tripwires when any group count
    exceeds [tripwire_threshold] (default 3). A blocking
    [evidence/review_warning.json] gap also emits a
    [review_requirement:submit_for_verification] tripwire so downstream
    coordinators can route through their verification FSM. A run with
    [mode_violations.json] but no populated [evidence/effects.json] source path
    emits [source_path_evidence:mode_enforcer].

    Returns [None] when no violations and no completeness gaps exist. *)
