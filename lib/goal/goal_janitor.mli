(** Goal_janitor — Periodic cleanup of stale and dropped goals.

    Four sweep rules:
    1. Purge: delete [Dropped] goals older than
       [dropped_ttl_days] (default 7).
    2. Stagnate: mark [Active] goals with no update after
       [stagnant_days] (default 30) as [Dropped].  Auto-generated
       goals (title suffix [" (auto)"] or ["… (auto)"], produced by
       {!Keeper_goal_repair}) use the shorter [auto_stagnant_days]
       threshold (default 7) so the keeper-repair leftovers do not
       accumulate.
    3. Orphan: remove [active_goal_ids] entries from each
       [keeper_meta] that reference non-existent goals in the Goal
       Store.
    4. Escalate: report stale unclaimed tasks without goal linkage.

(** {1 Configuration} *)

type sweep_config = {
  dropped_ttl_days : int;  (** Delete Dropped goals after this many days. *)
  stagnant_days : int;     (** Drop Active goals with no update after this many days. *)
  auto_stagnant_days : int;
      (** Drop {b auto-generated} Active goals with no update after this many
          days.  Auto-generated = title suffix [" (auto)"] or [{e … (auto)}]
          (the {!Keeper_goal_repair.goal_title_of_purpose} contract).
          Default 7 — short enough to keep keeper-repair leftovers from
          accreting, long enough to survive a transient operator pause. *)

val default_config : sweep_config

val runtime_config : unit -> sweep_config
(** [runtime_config ()] returns {!default_config} with
    [auto_stagnant_days] overridden by
    [MASC_GOAL_JANITOR_AUTO_STAGNATE_DAYS] when present.  Used by the
    server-side fiber and the dashboard-triggered sweep so operator
    overrides land in both paths.  Tests should keep using
    {!default_config} (or build a literal record) for determinism. *)

val is_auto_generated_goal : Goal_store.goal -> bool
(** [is_auto_generated_goal g] returns [true] when [g.title] carries
    the [" (auto)"] or [{e … (auto)}] suffix produced by
    {!Keeper_goal_repair.goal_title_of_purpose}.  Exposed for unit
    tests of the auto-stagnate branch. *)
