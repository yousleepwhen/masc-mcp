(** Goal_store — shared planning goals with a dedicated
    lifecycle phase.

    Persists goals under [<base>/.masc/goals.json] with an
    integer [version] counter and an ISO-8601 [updated_at]
    stamp.  Each goal carries:

    - a {!Goal_phase.t} (canonical lifecycle: [Executing] /
      [Awaiting_verification] / [Blocked] / [Completed] /
      [Paused] / [Dropped]),
    - a legacy {!goal_status} kept for backward-compat with
      consumers that have not migrated to phases yet
      (derived from phase on write, inferred on read for
      old rows),
    - a {!horizon} ([Short] / [Mid] / [Long]) used by the
      refresh / snapshot scheduler to decide which cohort
      to scan,
    - an optional {!Goal_verification.goal_verifier_policy}
      that gates entry into [Goal_phase.Completed].

    Every type is exposed concretely because external
    callers ([test/test_dashboard_goals], [test_goal_janitor],
    [test_keeper_task_dispatch],
    [lib/coord_goals],
    [lib/server/server_dashboard_http]) construct goal records
    by literal, pattern-match on every variant constructor,
    and access record fields ([.id], [.phase],
    [.updated_at], [.horizon], [.title], …) directly.

    Internal helpers stay private at this boundary
    ([refresh_mode], [snapshot_mode], [snapshot] type +
    function, [refresh_result], [refresh],
    [parse_refresh_mode], [parse_snapshot_mode],

      branch on [.phase] instead of [.status]. *)

    through. *)

(** {1 Phase ↔ legacy status bridge} *)

val goal_status_of_phase : Goal_phase.t -> goal_status
(** Forward derivation used on write.  Maps every phase to
    its canonical legacy status:

    - [Completed] → [Done]
    - [Blocked] / [Dropped] → [Dropped] *)

    are passed through the internal normaliser ([priority]
    clamp + phase/status reconciliation). *)

val write_state : Coord.config -> state -> unit
(** Direct overwrite of {!goals_path} with the supplied state.
    Used by tests that need deterministic initial state without
    the read-modify-write cycle of {!update_state}.

    Does *not* acquire the file lock; callers that need atomicity
    should use {!update_state} instead. *)

val update_state : Coord.config -> (state -> state) -> state
(** Atomic read-modify-write under the goals file lock.
    [f] receives the current state and returns the next state.
    The file lock protects against concurrent truncation races
    (#17229). *)

(** Creates a new goal when [id] is omitted (mints
    [goal-<ms>-<4 hex digits>] internally), updates the

    paired with [`created] / [`updated] so callers can
    branch on the outcome.

    Errors:

      on a new goal id).
    - [phase] and legacy [status] disagree (when both are
      supplied and {!phase_of_goal_status} of [status] does
      not equal [phase]). *)
