(** Tool_access_role — Role-based tool access policy builder.

    Maps each authentication role (Worker, Admin) to a
    Tool_access_policy.t that determines which tools the role can invoke.

    The role policy is derived from [Tool_permission_map.permission_for_tool], so
    Tool_catalog-declared required_permission metadata and auth-layer
    fallbacks stay aligned instead of maintaining a second hardcoded tool list.

    @since 2.204.0 — Phase 0 of Tool Gate architecture (#4381) *)

    Note: Keeper_denied and Keeper_internal filtering is handled separately
    by keeper_exec_tools and the mode gate (allow_direct_call), not by
    role policies. *)
