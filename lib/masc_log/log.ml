  (* RFC-0108: serialize the JSONL append under a single mutex
     critical section so concurrent fibers (or domains) cannot
     interleave bytes from different records.  Pre-fix, the three-
     call sequence [output_string oc json; output_char oc '\n';
     flush oc] left a race window between the JSON and the newline —
     observed on 2026-05-17 as ["}{"]-concat lines in
     [.masc/logs/system_log_2026-05-17.jsonl:3498] and [:4635].

     [Stdlib.Mutex] is sufficient here because [Ring.init_file_sink]
     runs before [Eio_main.run] (see [bin/main_eio.ml]); the writer
     therefore cannot assume an Eio scheduler is available and must
     work from non-Eio contexts (e.g. [at_exit]).  The mutex protects
     the single global [file_channel], so one lock covers the whole
     write path. Building the [json + "\n"] payload as a single
     string before [output_string] also keeps the kernel-visible
     write boundary at record granularity (the channel buffer is
     flushed once per record).

     [rotate_if_needed] runs outside the mutex on purpose — it only
     mutates [file_channel] when the date rolls, and recursing into
     the mutex there would deadlock.  Reading [!file_channel] inside
     the lock means a rotate racing with a write sees whichever
     channel is current; the worst case is one record on the
     about-to-rotate channel, which is harmless. *)
