    Delegates to [Agent_sdk.Tool_middleware.make_validation_hook] for strict
    type coercion and structured error feedback.  The pre-hook preserves the
    MASC transport contract by stripping underscore-prefixed protocol markers
    before validation. *)

(** Validate and normalize a tool argument object through the same OAS
    middleware used by [register_pre_hook].

    [?schema] lets direct OAS tool handlers validate against the schema they
    already hold, without depending on the global Tool_dispatch schema registry
    being populated in that execution path. When omitted, validation falls back
    to [Tool_dispatch.lookup_schema]. *)
