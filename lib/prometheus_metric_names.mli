(** Prometheus metric-name string constants — public counterpart to
    [Prometheus_metric_names.ml]. Extracted from [Prometheus] to keep
    the parent interface under the Godfile size cap.

    [Prometheus.mli] uses [include module type of Prometheus_metric_names]
    so callers see every [val metric_X : string] under the [Prometheus]
    namespace unchanged. *)

(** {1 Metric Name Constants}

    Shared SSOT between registration (in [init]) and call-sites in
    keeper/bridge modules. Importing [Prometheus.<constant>] ensures
    the compiler catches typos that would otherwise silently create
    dead series. *)

(** Current keeper world-observation idle seconds. Updated from
    [observation.idle_seconds] during keeper metrics emission so long idle
    gaps are visible as a scrapeable gauge, not only in message text.

(** Alive-but-stuck detector threshold seconds. Labels: [keeper_name]. *)

(** #12838 follow-up: alive-but-stuck recovery requests.  Each increment
    means the supervisor requested a supervised restart via
    [failure_reason] plus [fiber_stop]/[fiber_wakeup]. Labels: keeper. *)

(** #10121: keeper turn livelock observer counters.  Labels:
    [keeper].  Re-attempt = same turn id started again before
    the counter advanced; regression = turn id moved strictly
    backwards (write_meta race symptom — #9733); livelock blocks
    are labeled by [keeper, reason]. *)

    cascade is in provider cooldown and the keeper fail-opens to a
    fallback cascade.  Labels: [keeper, from_cascade, to_cascade]. *)

    Exposes the current cooldown duration so operators can see
    which cascade is blocked and for how long.  Labels: [keeper, cascade]. *)

    in cooldown each time a cooldown is applied or extended.

(** #10569 diagnostic: time spent waiting to acquire the board
    persist mutex.  High values point to writer-side contention:
    if N concurrent fibers serialize through this lock and any one
    holds it for K seconds during disk I/O, the (N-1)-th waiter
    sees ~(N-1)*K acquisition latency.

    Used together with [metric_board_persist_lock_held_sec] to
    distinguish queueing (acquire high, held low) from syscall stall
    (acquire low, held high).  Recorded once per [with_persist_lock]
    entry. *)

(** #10569 diagnostic: time spent inside the board persist lock,
    measured from acquisition to release.  Captures the actual disk
    I/O latency (append + rotate / atomic save) per persist call.

    Combined with [metric_board_persist_lock_acquire_sec] this
    gives operators the data to choose between (a) raising the
    per-board tool timeout, (b) introducing a write queue / batch,
    or (c) leaving the path synchronous when held time is already

    Combined with [metric_backend_mutex_held_sec] this distinguishes
    keeper write contention (acquire high) from disk I/O stall (held
    high) inside the storage layer. Read paths are not measured by
    these histograms.

    Wired by [Backend.FileSystem.set_mutex_observers] from the main
    library at startup so that [masc_backend] does not depend on
    [Prometheus]. *)

    Each increment corresponds to one extra [compute ()] call. No labels. *)
val metric_tool_keeper_cache_cas_conflicts : string

(** Counter for [File_lock_eio] lock-table CAS retries (both
    [prune_stale_entries] and [get_entry] share the same single
    [table] Atomic). Each increment corresponds to one extra
    [Atomic.compare_and_set] failure under fiber contention.
    Sustained non-zero rate indicates fan-out into the lock table
    under load. No labels — only one shared atomic in the module. *)

(** Counter for [Memory_jsonl.parse_line] silent drop events.
    Closed-vocabulary labels: [reason] in
    [no_key | not_assoc | json_parse_error].  Empty lines are

    for V15. *)
val metric_memory_jsonl_parse_drops : string

(** Counter for [tool_keeper.cache_ttl_seconds] env-var parse fallback events.
    Increments when the operator-supplied env var is present but unparseable

(** P-DASH-02: gauge for keeper turn wait queue depth.
    Labels: [channel] with [autonomous_queue] for the explicit autonomous

val metric_timeout_policy_overshoot : string

(** #9943: per-keeper noop compaction counter.  Increments when
    a snapshot records [compaction_before_tokens =
    compaction_after_tokens > 0] — the trigger fired but the
    strategy returned the same token budget.  Pre-fix, 956/972
    (98.4%) of compaction snapshots in production were silent
    noops because [masc_keeper_compactions_total] counts
    triggers rather than savings.  Labels: [keeper, trigger]. *)

(** Tier K5 — registry size for the per-keeper tool-emission
    accumulator (Tier K4c). Operators can alert on divergence from
    the active keeper count — a steady-state leak shows up as the
    gauge climbing past live keeper count without trending back
    down on keeper_down / supervisor cleanup. No labels. *)

(** Tier K6 — per-keeper tagged tool-emission push counter. Labels:
    [keeper]. Incremented by [Keeper_tool_emission_hook.push] each
    time the PostToolUse hook captures a parsed JSON tool result
    into the keeper's accumulator. *)

    otherwise. Labels: [keeper], [tool]. *)

(** #10349: counter incremented whenever
    [Keeper_alerting_path.resolve_keeper_read_path] rejects a
    path.  Replaces the previous user-facing leak of resolver
    allowed roots ([(roots=[<list>])] and
    [(sandbox roots: [<list>])]) which became a side-channel
    oracle for sibling sandboxes when keeper identity drifted
    across contract/gate/FS-resolver layers.  Labels:
    [kind="out_of_roots"|"not_found_relative"]. *)

val metric_write_meta_cas_retry_total : string

(** Total board signals that did not produce a wake decision for a
    running keeper. Increments per (keeper, kind) when
    [Keeper_world_observation.board_signal_wake_reason] returns
    [None] — no explicit_mention, scope feed disabled, and no
    external reply after a self-comment. Discoverability for the
    REPO_WAKE_UP audit finding: keepers with
    [room_signal_prompt_enabled = false] (Minimal preset default)
    silently drop board posts. Labels: keeper,

val metric_tool_policy_unloaded_query : string

val metric_tool_policy_init_failed : string
val metric_cache_desync_cleared : string
val metric_egress_audit_missing : string

(** Cascade state synchronization failures: pause/resume/auto-pause paths
    only. Local discovery refresh failures use
    [metric_keeper_local_discovery_failures] so dashboards can attribute
    distinct failure classes. *)
val metric_egress_audit_stale_orphan : string

(** Local discovery readiness failures observed during create/turn paths.
    Separated from [metric_keeper_cascade_sync_failures] so dashboards do
    not conflate cascade-state sync with discovery-refresh incompleteness. *)

(** #10091: labelled [keeper, has_current_task, contract_status]
    so fleet histograms can distinguish the active-task strict
    path from the no-task path covered by #10031. *)

(** #10474: counter incremented when a keeper's cascade has zero
    tool-capable providers.  Labels: keeper, cascade. *)

(** #10474: counter classifying each scheduled autonomous cycle outcome.
    Labels: keeper, outcome=[tool_called|noop|error]. *)

(** #12799 Total passive-loop detections: keeper completed N consecutive turns
    using only passive read-only tools, violating the proactive contract.
    Incremented once per loop episode (streak resets on any execution-progress
    turn). Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** #13362 Total required-tool contract loops: keeper hit N consecutive
    actionable required-tool failures before making execution/completion
    progress.  Incremented once per loop episode. Labels: [keeper, kind]. *)

(** Goal-loop Observe counter for no-progress keeper loops. Emitted by the
    passive/required-tool loop detector when progress-signalling turns make no
    execution or completion progress. Incremented once per loop episode.
    Labels: [keeper_name]. *)

(** #13631 Total Require_tool_use gate suppressions caused by actionable
    affordances whose visible keeper tool surface contains no
    contract-satisfying tool. Labels: [affordance]. *)

(** Task-138 Current consecutive-idle streak (passive-only turns) per
    keeper.  Resets to 0 on the next execution/completion turn.  Pairs
    with [metric_keeper_passive_loop_detected_total]: the counter fires
    only at the threshold crossing, this gauge lets dashboards see the
    streak rising before the latch.  Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** Task-138 Unix timestamp of the most recent productive turn
    (execution/completion class) per keeper.  Reads as 0 until the
    keeper has produced anything in this process.  Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** PR-B: counter incremented when [run_keeper_cycle] skips a turn
    because the keeper's resolved cascade is ollama-only and the
    [/api/ps] probe reports zero process_available slots.  Labelled
    by [keeper] and [cascade] so dashboards can attribute starvation
    to specific cascade profiles. *)
