(** MCP tool schemas for room management operations (core).

    Only schemas dispatched by Tool_coord remain here.
    Other schemas have been moved to their owning modules:

(** Issue #8636: hand-mirrored from
    [Tool_coord.valid_assertion_strings]. Cycle constraint —
    [Tool_schemas_coord_core] is upstream of [Tool_coord] (the schema
    library lives in [masc_tool_schemas], the handler is in [masc_mcp]).
    The test [test_types.ml :: assertion_kind_ssot] asserts this mirror
    stays in sync with the SSOT so adding a 6th assertion kind fails
    compilation in [assertion_kind_to_string] AND fails the test here,
    instead of silently dropping from the JSON Schema. *)
