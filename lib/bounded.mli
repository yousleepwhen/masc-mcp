(** Bounded — Constrained multi-agent execution loop with formal
    guarantees.

    Termination, safety, and soundness properties from MAGI review
    (Provider_f + Qwen3 formal verification):

    - {b Termination}: always terminates via
      {!constraints.hard_max_iterations}.
    - {b Safety}: post-execution constraint check prevents silent
      violations (turns / tokens / cost / time).
    - {b Soundness}: typed comparisons + explicit error handling
      via {!comparison} variants and parser fallbacks.

    Internal: 13 helpers stay private — \[bounded_rng] (Random.State
    seeded at module load), \[retryable_error_re] (14 hoisted Re.t
    patterns), \[create_state], \[check_single] / \[check_single_float]
    / \[check_constraints] / \[check_constraints_with_buffer],
    \[resolve_path] / \[json_to_float], \[update_state],
    \[format_agent_failure] / \[format_agent_execution_failure],
    \[retry_config_of_json].  All consumed only inside
    {!bounded_run} or the {!constraints_of_json} parser.

    The predictive token-budget check used to read a token-buffer magic
    constant. Since RFC-0028 it instead consults
    {!Usage_history.predict_p95} over per-agent empirical
    distributions, falling back to a documented constant only when
    fewer than ten samples have accumulated for an agent. *)

(** {1 Goal conditions} *)

(** Comparison operators for goal conditions.  [Eq] / [Neq] take

type goal = {

  condition : comparison;
}
(** Goal condition.  [path] uses a minimal JSONPath subset
    ([$.field], [$.field.subfield]); see {!check_goal} for
    resolution. *)

(** {1 Retry / constraints} *)

type retry_config = {
  max_retries : int;          (** Maximum retry attempts per agent call. *)
  base_delay_ms : int;        (** Base delay (ms) before exponential growth. *)

val default_retry_config : retry_config

    [max_delay_ms = 30000], [jitter_factor = 0.2]. *)

type constraints = {
  max_turns : int option;
  max_tokens : int option;
  max_cost_usd : float option;
  max_time_seconds : float option;
  hard_max_iterations : int;   (** Absolute failsafe — termination guarantee. *)
  retry : retry_config;
}

val default_constraints : constraints
(** Safe defaults: [max_turns = Some 10], [max_tokens = Some 100000],
    [max_cost_usd = Some 1.0], [max_time_seconds = Some 300.0],
    [hard_max_iterations = 100], [retry = default_retry_config]. *)

(** {1 Execution state} *)

type bounded_state = {
  mutable turns : int;
  mutable tokens_in : int;

(** Mutable execution accumulator.  Carried through the loop and
    snapshotted into {!bounded_result.stats} at termination. *)

(** {1 Per-agent token-usage history (RFC-0028)} *)

module Usage_history : sig
  (** Empirical distribution of per-turn output-token counts, keyed
      by agent name.  Populated by {!bounded_run} after each successful
      spawn (see RFC-0028 §4.4).  Used by the predictive token-budget
      check to estimate the next turn's cost from the high quantile
      of the recent samples instead of the linear average that
      {!check_constraints_with_buffer} historically used.

      Storage is a module-level hashtable (one bounded ring buffer per
      agent) protected by an internal mutex.  All operations are
      O(samples) with samples capped at 64 per agent. *)

  val record : agent:string -> tokens_out:int -> unit
  (** [record ~agent ~tokens_out] appends a sample to [agent]'s ring
      buffer.  When the buffer is full the oldest sample is evicted
      first.  Negative or zero [tokens_out] are dropped silently —
      mock spawns and degenerate turns must not pollute the
      distribution. *)

  val predict_p95 : ?agent:string -> unit -> int
  (** [predict_p95 ?agent ()] returns the 95th-percentile output-token
      count for [agent]'s recent samples.  When [agent] is omitted or
      fewer than [min_samples_for_p95] samples are recorded for that
      agent, returns {!unknown_agent_fallback}.  The agent's queue is
      copied and sorted; the source ring buffer is not mutated. *)

  val sample_count : ?agent:string -> unit -> int
  (** [sample_count ?agent ()] returns the current number of samples
      recorded for [agent], or [0] when no agent is supplied or the
      agent has no samples.  Test inspection helper — not consumed in
      production paths. *)

  val reset : unit -> unit
  (** [reset ()] clears every agent's ring buffer.  Used by the test
      suite to isolate cases that depend on a fresh distribution. *)

  val min_samples_for_p95 : int
  (** Minimum samples required before {!predict_p95} returns a
      distribution-derived value.  Below this threshold the predictor
      returns {!unknown_agent_fallback} instead of a noisy estimate.
      Currently [10] (RFC-0028 §4.2). *)

  val unknown_agent_fallback : int
  (** Conservative per-turn output-token estimate used when the
      empirical distribution for an agent is missing or too small.
      Currently [1024] (RFC-0028 §4.2 — the value lacks measurement
      evidence today and is intentionally documented as such). *)
end

(** {1 Helpers (test-visible)} *)

val calc_backoff_delay : retry_config -> int -> int
(** [calc_backoff_delay retry_config attempt] returns the next
    delay in ms: exponential ([base * 2^attempt]) capped by
    [max_delay_ms], plus uniform jitter in
    [\[-jitter_range/2, +jitter_range/2\]] with
    [jitter_range = capped * jitter_factor]. *)

val is_retryable_error : string -> bool
(** [is_retryable_error msg] is [true] when [msg] describes a
    transient local retry condition and [false] for hard-quota /
    capacity-exhaustion text.  The transient detector matches the 14
    hoisted patterns [timeout], [timed out], [connection refused],
    [connection reset], [network], [ECONNREFUSED], [ETIMEDOUT],
    [rate limit], [429], [503], [502], [504], [overloaded],
    [temporarily unavailable] via pre-compiled case-insensitive
    DFAs.  Hard quota/capacity exhaustion short-circuits to [false]
    even when the message also contains [429], because same-agent
    retry cannot repair an exhausted account; cascade/keeper
    classifiers own cross-provider fallback and cooldown. *)

val check_goal : Yojson.Safe.t -> goal -> bool
(** [check_goal result goal] resolves [goal.path] under [result]
    and evaluates [goal.condition] against the resolved value.
    Returns [false] when the path does not resolve. *)

  reason : string;
  final_output : string option;
  stats : bounded_state;
  history : history_entry list;
  warning : string option;
}
(** Terminal result.  [status] enumerates the 3 termination modes;
    [final_output] is set on success or partial-result constraint
    exceedance.  [warning] carries a post-check observation when
    constraints were tight but not exceeded mid-loop. *)

(** {1 JSON encoding} *)

val result_to_json : bounded_result -> Yojson.Safe.t
(** [result_to_json result] renders the result as a JSON object
    suitable for tool output.  Status string is one of
    ["goal_reached"] / ["constraint_exceeded"] / ["error"].
    [stats.elapsed_seconds] is computed at render time
    ([Time_compat.now () -. stats.start_time]) — successive renders
    of the same result drift in the [elapsed_seconds] field. *)

val constraints_of_json : Yojson.Safe.t -> constraints
(** [constraints_of_json json] parses a constraints object.
    [json = `Null] returns {!default_constraints} verbatim.
    Missing scalar fields fall back to {!default_constraints}
    via {!Safe_ops}.  Unknown keys are silently ignored
    (permissive). *)

val goal_of_json : Yojson.Safe.t -> goal
(** [goal_of_json json] parses a goal object with [path] +
    [condition].  Recognised condition keys: [eq], [neq], [lt],
    [lte], [gt], [gte], [between] (2-element array), [in].
    Default when no key matches: [Eq (`Bool true)] (truthy
    check).  [between] arrays with fewer than 2 elements raise
    [Invalid_argument "Bounded.rule_of_yojson: 'between' array
    must have at least 2 elements"]. *)
