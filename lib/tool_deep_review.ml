(** Tool_deep_review — Adversarial code review with isolated context.

    PR#814 Gap 2: Spawns a review pass using a different model perspective.
    Context is deliberately stripped — only target file contents and the
    reviewer's question are provided. No JIRA, Slack, memory, or
    institutional knowledge.

    This forces the reviewer to evaluate code structurally rather than
    relying on domain context that might mask bugs.

    Uses the same [Oas_worker.run_named] pattern as {!Verifier_oas}. *)
