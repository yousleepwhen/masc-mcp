(** RFC-0107 Phase D Connection Pool — interface skeleton.

    Phase D.2a delivers the interface only; implementations raise
    [Failure "Pool.<fn>: not implemented (Phase D.2b)"] until the piaf
    binding lands in D.2b.

    Design rationale lives in [docs/rfc/RFC-0107-phase-d-pool-design.md].
    Critical findings absorbed from Phase B Prior Art research
    ([knowledge/research/2026-05-17-piaf-ocsigen-eio-fd-prior-art.md]):

    - piaf's [Client.t] is per-endpoint, not multi-host. We build the
      [Host_key -> piaf Client.t queue] layer ourselves on top.
    - cohttp upstream patch is not viable (issue #85 closed 2014, eio
      not covered). piaf is the only rational transport choice.
    - Eio #244 "exactly-one-owner" principle motivates the no-double-
      release invariant enforced by the [request] / [with_connection]
      callback API (no naked acquire / release exposed). *)

(** Opaque per-process connection pool. Attaches to a long-lived
    [Eio.Switch] (typically server root_sw via [Eio_context]). The pool
    survives turn boundaries; per-host connection state evicts on
    [idle_ttl]. *)
type t

(** Pool tuning parameters. Conservative defaults derived from
    RFC-0101 §2 nofile cap (10240).

    [max_idle_per_host]: bound on idle (reusable) connections kept per
    {scheme, host, port} tuple after a request completes.

    [max_total_idle]: bound on idle connections across all hosts. When
    exceeded, the LRU host's oldest idle connection is evicted before
    a new one is parked.

    [idle_ttl_seconds]: idle connection's max age before eviction. A
    pool fiber walks idle queues periodically; expired entries are
    closed and dropped.

    [connect_timeout_seconds]: max wait when establishing a fresh
    connection. Surfaces as [Error "connect timeout ..."] to the
    caller. *)

(** Initialize the pool on a long-lived switch (server root_sw). Idle
    connections close when [sw] closes; in-flight requests outlive
    pool cleanup via per-call sub-switches.

    [env] is the full Eio standard environment, required by the piaf
    transport (h1/h2 client creation). The pool keeps a reference and
    issues [Piaf.Client.create ~sw env uri] internally on cache miss. *)

(** Scoped one-shot request. Acquires a connection from the per-host
    pool (or creates one if the pool is empty / under
    [max_idle_per_host]), issues the request, releases the connection
    back to the pool for keep-alive reuse, and returns the typed
    response.

    Failure modes (all return [Error]):
    - DNS / TCP / TLS failure during connect
    - HTTP read error during reuse (pool drops the bad connection)
    - timeout when [clock] and [timeout_seconds] are both provided

    Notably absent: silent retry. If a reused connection fails, the
    caller sees [Error] with the underlying reason. Caller decides
    whether to retry — N-of-M silent retry is an
    RFC-0107 §"Workaround Rejection Bar" anti-pattern. *)

(** {2 RFC-0129 — idle-timeout request with streaming progress}

    Replaces the wall-clock total-timeout pattern used by [request].
    Chunk arrival on the response body resets the idle timer; a stream
    that keeps delivering bytes is never cancelled, regardless of total
    elapsed time. A stream that stops producing bytes for longer than
    [idle_timeout_sec] is cancelled.

    Progress fields are returned on both the [Ok] and [Error] branches
    so cascade rotation receipts can attach them without a side-channel.

    Design rationale: docs/rfc/RFC-0129-http-idle-timeout-and-streaming-progress.md *)

    timestamps are seconds since request start (monotonic). *)

(** Issue a request with body-idle cancellation. Chunk delivery resets
    the idle timer; absence of bytes for [idle_timeout_sec] cancels the
    fiber. [total_timeout_sec] is an optional hard cap that bounds the
    request regardless of streaming activity (default: no hard cap;
    keeper turn budget bounds the outer loop).

    Progress is observed even on failure. Error string carries one of:
    - ["idle timeout after %.1fs"]      (body silent past idle_timeout_sec)
    - ["total timeout after %.1fs"]     (total_timeout_sec elapsed)
    - any Piaf error message. *)

val with_connection :
  t ->

(** Scoped low-level handle for streaming bodies (voice_bridge). The
    callback runs with a connection borrowed from the pool; on return
    (success or exception) the connection is released back to the
    pool. Most callers should use [request] instead.

    Phase D.2b will refine the callback signature to expose the
    transport handle (piaf [Client.t] or equivalent). *)
