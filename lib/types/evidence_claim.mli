(** Evidence_claim — typed deterministic verification evidence (RFC-0199 Phase A).

    Closed sum type for evidence that can be checked without verifier
    judgment: PR merged, CI pass, command exit code, file existence,
    artifact size. Future RFC-0199 Phase B (Deterministic_evidence_evaluator)
    consumes [t list] from [task_contract.required_evidence_typed] and
    emits a typed CDAL verdict.

    Boundary: this module defines the schema only. It does NOT perform
    evaluation, network I/O, or file stat. Evaluation lives in
    [Deterministic_evidence_evaluator] with injected dependencies so
    pure callers (parsers, validators, tests) can manipulate claims
    without side effects.

    Anti-pattern guards (RFC-0088):
    - Closed sum forces exhaustive match in every evaluator.
    - [Custom_check] is the only escape hatch and requires a typed
      [id] from an allowlist + structured [payload]; not a free-form
      string-classifier surface.
