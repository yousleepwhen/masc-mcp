(** #10097: per-(provider, tool) counter for keeper-bound runtime MCP
    omissions.  Paired with a once-per-fingerprint WARN log so logs
    carry structural facts and Prometheus carries frequency.

    RFC-0058 §2.4 / Phase 5.4: renamed from
    `masc_cli_tool_a_mcp_tool_omission_total` to keep provider identity
    out of the metric name; `provider` is now a label. *)

    given [name]. Edge-triggered: subsequent drops in the same window
    bump only [metric_keeper_registry_update_dropped]. Labeled by [name]. *)

(** PR-J: number of times the per-turn OAS event-bus drain helper ran,
    labelled by call-site so operators can attribute drain pressure
    (e.g. background poller vs. unsubscribe vs. retry path).
    Labels: [site, outcome]. [outcome] is [drained] (events were
    pulled) or [empty] (subscriber returned no pending events). *)

(** Total keeper transitions to [Dead] phase after restart-budget exhaustion.
    Labeled by [keeper] and [reason]. Operators should alert on any rate >0:
    by construction Dead means the supervisor gave up and no further
    restart will be attempted. *)

(** Total keepers auto-resumed by the self-healing circuit breaker in
    [Keeper_supervisor.sweep_and_recover] after the per-keeper back-off
    timer elapsed.  Labeled by [keeper].  A positive rate indicates the
    system is self-healing from transient provider outages without operator
    intervention.  A sustained zero rate while [auto_resume_after_sec] is
    set in meta files indicates a sweep or meta-write regression. *)

(** Total keepers whose auto-resume was blocked in
    [Keeper_supervisor.sweep_and_recover] because the cascade health probe
    reported unhealthy (failure ratio >= threshold).  Labeled by [keeper]
    and [cascade].  A positive rate means the health gate is protecting
    the fleet from resuming into a still-failing cascade. *)

(** RFC-0020 Rule 2 evidence — incremented every time
    [run_smart_heartbeat_gate] overrides a [Skip_busy] / [Skip_idle]
    decision because the Event Layer queue
    ([Keeper_registry_event_queue.snapshot]) was non-empty. A zero
    rate against ongoing keeper activity means either the queue
    write path (PR-C1 [wakeup_keeper ?stimulus]) is not firing or
    the smart heartbeat is already returning [Emit] on its own —
    either way operators can distinguish. Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** Positive signal for the #12271 Skip_idle + Woken fix path. Increments
    each time [run_smart_heartbeat_gate] observes an external [wakeup_keeper]
    cut a Skip_idle backoff sleep short and the cycle was resumed
    ([cycle_continues_after_wake] -> [true]). Operator-meaningful pair with
    [masc_keeper_stale_termination_by_class_total] (class=idle_turn): a
    healthy fleet should show non-zero rates here proportional to inbound
    board signals, with the idle_turn kill rate trending toward zero. A
    zero rate after operator-visible signals suggests either the wakeup
    never reached the atomic, or a regression silently re-introduced
    MissedWakeup (KeeperHeartbeat.tla bug action).
    Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** Total stimuli consumed at turn entry, classified by [stimulus_class].
    Labels: [keeper], [class]
    (board_signal|bootstrap|alive_but_stuck_recovery|unsupported).
    Pairs with [masc_keeper_unsupported_stimulus_total] for unsupported-only
    drill-down with payload prefix. *)

(** Unsupported stimuli consumed at turn entry — the dequeued payload
    did not match any known stimulus class. Each increment represents a
    wake -> no_signal gap per #12684. Labels: [keeper]. *)

    Dead keepers. Increments each time a Dead keeper passes eligibility
    checks and a recovery is launched. Labels: [keeper]. *)

(** #12801 Total Liveness Recovery Supervisor outcomes. Labels:
    [keeper, outcome]. Outcome is one of:
    - [started]: keeper re-registered and fiber launched successfully
    - [not_running]: keeper re-registered but not in Running state after launch
    - [meta_missing]: no keeper meta file found — recovery skipped
    - [meta_read_failed]: meta read I/O error — recovery skipped
    - [meta_write_failed]: meta write to clear [paused] failed *)

(** PR-M (Leak 9): consecutive [provider_timeout] cycle FAILED strikes.
    Labeled by [keeper] and [outcome]:
    - [outcome=warn]: strike below [provider_timeout_strike_limit];
      cycle continues.
    - [outcome=soft_backoff]: strike at or above limit; keeper fiber
      remains alive while provider/cascade cooldown and retry backoff
      throttle later turns.
    - [outcome=promote]: policy allowed keeper death because separate
      liveness evidence exists. Counter reset on any successful turn. *)

(** Gauge: per-subscriber [Eio.Stream] capacity chosen at bus creation.
    Labels: [bus] names the MASC bus ([oas_runtime] | [masc_domain]),
    [policy] names the [Agent_sdk.Event_bus.backpressure_policy].
    Published once per bus at [Masc_event_bus_policy.create_bus] so
    operators can interpret [metric_oas_bus_subscriber_stream_depth]
    as a fraction of capacity. *)

(** Counter: OAS [Agent_sdk.Event_bus.payload] variants that the
    cascade event bridge did not have an explicit arm for and
    degraded to a kind-only SSE payload via the catch-all in
    [Cascade_event_bridge.native_event_to_json].  Labels: [kind]
    carries [Agent_sdk.Event_bus.payload_kind other] (snake_case,
    one-to-one with the upstream OAS payload constructor name —
    cardinality is bounded by the OAS variant set and grows only
    on upstream pin bumps).

    A non-zero rate means an OAS pin bump shipped a new payload
    variant before the masc-mcp consumer was migrated.  The catch-all
    is deliberate (see [Cascade_event_bridge.native_event_to_json])
    but degrades SSE subscribers to a kind-only payload, so this
    counter is the per-process signal that an explicit arm needs
    to be added.  Fix: extend the explicit match in
    [lib/cascade/cascade_event_bridge.ml] for the offending [kind].

    Pairs with the per-occurrence WARN log
    ["oas_event_bridge: kind-only fallback ..."]. *)

(** Counter: occurrences where
    [Cascade_attempt_fsm.provider_label] received an empty or
    whitespace-only string and substituted the literal ["unknown"]
    label.  No labels (the empty-input case is the only signal —
    cardinality 1).

    A non-zero rate means an upstream metric/log emitter is passing
    an empty provider through {!Cascade_attempt_fsm.provider_label}.
    The helper paints over the symptom for metric-label safety; this
    counter and the paired WARN line are the operator's signal that
    the source needs a real provider value.  Fix: trace the
    paired ["[cascade_attempt:empty_provider_label]"] WARN to the
    call site and pass a real provider through. *)
val metric_cascade_attempt_empty_provider_label : string

(** Counter: tool-result blocks compacted by
    [Keeper_context_core.sanitize_checkpoint_message] because the
    raw content would have exceeded a budget.  Labels are
    closed-vocabulary (cardinality 6):

    - [action] = [stubbed | truncated].
      [stubbed] replaces the content with a marker string so the
      block contributes essentially zero bytes; [truncated] keeps a
      prefix and appends a cap marker.
    - [reason] = [over_count | over_aggregate_bytes | over_single_byte].
      [over_count] = per-message tool-result count cap reached.
      [over_aggregate_bytes] = adding this result would exceed the
      cumulative tool-result byte budget for the message.
      [over_single_byte] = this single result exceeds the per-result
      byte cap.

    A persistent non-zero rate means operators are losing tool-result
    payload at checkpoint time; the [reason] label tells them which
    cap to revisit (per-result vs aggregate vs count). *)

    errors (EBADF, EIO, ENOMEM, …) and lost any output between the
