(** Timeout policy SSOT for MASC-MCP.

    Consolidates the layered wall-clock deadline matrix enumerated in
    https://github.com/jeong-sik/masc-mcp/issues/9639, and provides a typed
    [Deadline.t] that can be propagated across subsystems.

    Cooperative-cancel overshoot: OCaml 5 / Eio cancellation is cooperative.
    A fiber that blocks inside an uncancellable region (native HTTP bulk
    read, system call, non-yielding loop) will miss the
    [Eio.Time.with_timeout_exn] deadline and overshoot the configured budget
    by seconds. [overshoot_warn] surfaces the overshoot as a first-class
    log/metric signal so the condition is visible instead of silently
    inflating wall time.

    Related issues: #9639 (meta), #9662 (keeper_llm_bridge ~24s overshoot),
    #9629 (governance OAS 60s), #9637 (keeper turn 1200s). *)

    Returns [true] when an overshoot was detected (caller no
    longer needs to emit a parallel counter). *)
