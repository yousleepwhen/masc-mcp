(** Discovery_cache — cached wrapper over OAS Provider Discovery.

    All probing logic lives in OAS. This module adds:
    - TTL-based caching (30s default)
    - Convenience queries (any_local_healthy, idle/busy counts)
    - Eio capability injection (set_env at server init)

    @since 2.130.0 *)

(* Probe every configured endpoint and install the result under the
   mutex.  The probe itself ([Llm_provider.Discovery.discover])
   makes HTTP requests — potentially several seconds of network
   I/O — so it must NOT be executed while holding [cache_mu].

   The prior version was named [refresh_cache_unlocked] and was
   called from inside [get_cached_or_refresh]'s [Eio.Mutex.use_rw]
   block, which meant every dashboard / local-runtime consumer
   waited on the mutex for the full probe duration.  That is the
   same drift class as the prompt_registry [_unlocked] variants
   fixed in PR #6663 — the in-tree API was refactored to keep I/O
   out of the critical section, but a sibling helper with a
   misleading "_unlocked" name was left with the old pattern.

   This version splits the work: the HTTP probe runs with no lock
   held, then the result is installed under the mutex.  Two
   concurrent refreshers may both probe; that is wasteful but
   correct.  In practice the 30 s TTL narrows the window. *)
