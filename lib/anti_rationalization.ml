(** Anti-rationalization gate for task completion.

    Detects avoidance patterns in completion notes and optionally verifies
    with a cheap LLM call.  Modeled after Trail of Bits' Stop hook pattern.

    Gate ordering:
    1. Empty/trivially-short notes  → immediate Reject (no LLM needed)
    2. Known excuse pattern match   → Reject with pattern name
    3. LLM review (cascade:verifier) → APPROVE / REJECT
    4. LLM unavailable              → Approve (liveness > correctness)
