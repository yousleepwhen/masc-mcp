(** Resilience keeper_bridge — post-turn resilience pipeline.

    Cycle 23 / Tier A6.

    {1 What this module is}

    A6 wires the {!Recovery} classifier and the canonical
    {!Recovery.default_strategy} mapping into the keeper post-turn
    lifecycle. It runs {b immediately after} the A5 autonomous
    wire-in: the keeper-side dispatch enforces the strict ordering
    [autonomous tick → resilience classification → audit log entry].

    {1 Two surfaces}

    - {b Pure helpers} ({!masc_resilience_enabled},
      {!upsert_resilience_meta}): mirror the A5
      [Autonomous.Wirein_helpers] pattern so [Keeper_post_turn]
      dispatches through this module without pulling the full
      Resilience implementation into the keeper sub-library closure.
    - {b Main pipeline} ({!apply_post_turn_resilience}): given an
      optional error string surfaced by the just-completed turn,
      classify it via {!Recovery.classify_string}, derive the
      canonical strategy class via {!Recovery.default_strategy},
      optionally execute it through caller-supplied concrete
      callbacks, append an audit envelope (when an audit store is
      supplied), and return a [`Assoc] meta sub-tree to be merged
      into [working_context["resilience_meta"]].

    {1 Feature flag contract}

    [MASC_RESILIENCE] is independent from A5's [MASC_AUTONOMOUS].
    A5 wire-in may be active without A6, and vice versa. The
    keeper-side dispatch enforces the [autonomous → resilience]
    ordering only when both are enabled; either flag being off
    short-circuits its pipeline to a no-op pass-through.

    {1 Phantom witness}

    {!running_valid_for_resilience} is a cooperation token the
    keeper produces only after consulting
    [Keeper_state_machine.can_execute_turn]. The bridge cannot
    be invoked without it, so non-Running keepers are excluded
    at the type level rather than via runtime guard.

val masc_resilience_enabled : unit -> bool
(** [true] iff the [MASC_RESILIENCE] environment variable is set

    working_context with the ["resilience_meta"] key set to [meta].

    - [wc = None] → fresh [`Assoc] with one entry.
    - [wc = Some (`Assoc kv)] → preserves all keys other than
      ["resilience_meta"] and replaces (or adds) that single entry.
      Critically, this preserves an A5-emitted ["autonomous_meta"]
      entry — the two wire-ins coexist in the same working_context.
    - [wc = Some other] (non-[`Assoc] payload) → wraps under a fresh
      [`Assoc] holding only ["resilience_meta"]. The caller is
      expected to use [`Assoc] working_contexts; this branch exists
      for graceful fallback. *)
