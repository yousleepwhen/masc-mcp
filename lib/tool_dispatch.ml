(** Central Tool Dispatch Registry — O(1) Hashtbl-based dispatch.

    Replaces the 40+ sequential match chain in mcp_server_eio.ml with
    a single Hashtbl lookup.  Each Tool_X module registers a closure
    that captures its own context, so the dispatch layer does not need
    to know about heterogeneous context types.

    Activated by MASC_DISPATCH_V2=1; the legacy match chain is the
    default fallback. *)

(** Unified handler type: every tool call is [name * args -> result option].
    [None] means "this handler does not know this tool" (should not happen
    when lookups go through the registry, but kept for compatibility). *)

(** Bulk-register every tool name from a schema list to the same handler.
    This is the primary registration path — it extracts names from the
    module's published schemas, ensuring the registry is always in sync
    with the advertised tool list. *)

    caller gets a consistent result shape. *)

(** {2 Dispatch Hooks}

    Pre-hooks run before the handler; post-hooks run after.
    Multiple hooks are supported — they execute in registration order.

    - Pre-hook returning [Some result] short-circuits (handler is skipped).
      Use case: permission checks (Sprint 3), request logging.
    - Post-hook transforms the result.  Identity function when observing only.
      Use case: tracing spans (Sprint 2), metrics collection. *)

    and the pre-hook's result is returned directly.
