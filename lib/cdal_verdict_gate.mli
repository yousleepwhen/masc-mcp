(** Cdal_verdict_gate — Deterministic gate that blocks task completion
    when the latest CDAL verdict is [Violated] or [Inconclusive] with
    blocking completeness gaps.

    Reads from [cdal_verdicts/*.jsonl] (produced by
    [Cdal_eval_v1.persist]). Gate logic is pure:
    - [Satisfied] → allow
    - [Violated] → reject with findings summary
    - [Inconclusive] with no blocking gaps → allow
    - [Inconclusive] with blocking gaps → reject with gap summary
    - No verdict available → allow (gate is opt-in per task) *)

(** {1 Types} *)

type gate_result =
  | Allow
  | Reject of string

(** {1 Pure gate logic} *)

(** Translate a verdict to [Allow] / [Reject reason] per the rules
    documented above. Pure — no I/O. *)
val check_verdict : Cdal_types.contract_verdict -> gate_result

(** {1 Gate labels for attribution recording}

    Attribution ring-buffer entries are grouped by gate name. Two
    labels are published so advisory vs. strict-enforced verdicts can
    be counted separately in the dashboard. *)

val strict_gate_label : string
(** ["cdal_verdict"]. Used when a rejection actually blocks
    completion. *)

val advisory_gate_label : string
(** ["cdal_verdict_advisory"]. Used when [contract.strict = false]
    and the rejection is dropped — the audit trail is kept but the
    task is allowed through. *)

(** {1 Task completion gate} *)

(** [gate_check ?base_dir ?gate_label ?warn_on_missing ~task_id ()] looks up the latest
    verdict for [task_id] under [base_dir] (default: CDAL verdict
    directory resolved from MASC base path) and returns:

    - [None] — completion is allowed.
    - [Some reason] — completion must be rejected.

    [gate_label] controls the attribution-ring gate name (defaults to
    {!strict_gate_label}). Callers operating on advisory contracts
    should pass [~gate_label:advisory_gate_label] so the dashboard can
    distinguish the two buckets. The return value is unaffected by
    the label.

    [warn_on_missing] controls operator-visible missing-verdict WARNs.
    Strict gates should keep the default [true]. Advisory or
    attribution-only callers may pass [false] to record attribution
    without repeating a non-blocking warning. *)

(** [lookup_latest_verdict ?base_dir ?warn_on_missing ?limit ~task_id ()] — the
    primitive that {!gate_check} composes with attribution recording.
    Exposed so diagnostic tools and tests can call it without
    importing the attribution side effect.

    On miss with a saturated starting [limit], the lookup auto-widens
    once to [limit * 16] before returning [None] — operators no longer
    need to guess [MASC_CDAL_VERDICT_LOOKUP_LIMIT] in normal-fleet
    cases (#10731). *)

(** {1 Attribution wiring} *)

(** [to_attribution ?gate_label v] maps [check_verdict v] to the
    matching {!Attribution.t} — [Allow] → [passed], [Reject reason] →
    [policy_failed]. [gate_label] defaults to {!strict_gate_label}. *)
val to_attribution : ?gate_label:string -> Cdal_types.contract_verdict -> Attribution.t

(** Attribution used when no verdict exists for a task.
    [gate_label] defaults to {!strict_gate_label}. Trailing [unit]
    is required so the optional argument can be erased. *)
val attribution_for_missing_verdict :
  ?gate_label:string -> task_id:string -> unit -> Attribution.t

(** {1 Ledger health (#10115)}

    The verdict gate reads from a JSONL ledger maintained by
    [Cdal_eval_v1.persist].  When the writer pipeline goes
    dormant (observed: 12-day gap before #10115) the reader gate
    keeps firing "no verdict found" advisories that have no
    grounded fix — operator-visible WARNs misdirect the
    investigation toward [MASC_CDAL_VERDICT_LOOKUP_LIMIT].
    {!ledger_health_report} surfaces the underlying file-system
    state so a boot-time check (or a [sb] introspection tool)
    can detect dormancy at the source. *)

type ledger_health = {
  base_dir : string;          (** Directory the report was taken from. *)
  total_files : int;          (** Count of [DD.jsonl] files found. *)
  latest_mtime : float option;
    (** Newest [DD.jsonl] mtime in Unix seconds, or [None] when no
        files exist. *)
  age_seconds : float option;
    (** [now - latest_mtime] when [latest_mtime] is set; [None]
        otherwise. *)
}

val ledger_health_report : ?base_dir:string -> unit -> ledger_health
(** Snapshot the on-disk state of the verdict ledger.  No I/O on
    the verdict contents themselves; only readdir + stat.  Pure
    introspection — does not log. *)

val stale_age_seconds_default : float
(** Default staleness threshold (7 days) used by
    {!log_ledger_health_warn_if_stale}. *)

val log_ledger_health_warn_if_stale :
  ?base_dir:string ->
  ?stale_age_seconds:float ->
  unit -> ledger_health
(** Combines {!ledger_health_report} with a structured WARN line
    when the ledger is empty or older than [stale_age_seconds].
    Returns the same report so the caller can also publish it on
    a metrics surface.  Intended for boot-time wiring or a
    dedicated [sb cdal health] command. *)
