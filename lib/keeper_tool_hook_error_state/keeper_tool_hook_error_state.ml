(* Typed dedupe state for the Keeper_hooks_oas on_tool_error ERROR log noise.

   See the .mli for the rationale and the production system_log evidence
   that motivates this noise-dedupe layer. The module is intentionally
   backed by the stdlib-only [Bounded_event_dedupe] state machine, so
   it can be linked into both the main library and a standalone Alcotest
   executable without dragging Eio in.

   Sibling of [Keeper_tool_retry_state] (lib/keeper_tool_retry_state/).
   Same state-machine shape, different fingerprint dimension: the retry
   module keys on [(tool, signature)] because the retry loop iterates
   within a single keeper context, while this module keys on [(keeper,
   tool, signature)] because the hook fires per-keeper and two different
   keepers seeing the same tool error are legitimately distinct ERROR
   events.

   Threading: [Bounded_event_dedupe] guards the in-memory table with a
   single [Mutex.t]. All public entry points perform only key creation
   and integer state updates, so contention is bounded.

   Memory: there is no eviction policy. The set of distinct
   (keeper_name, tool_name, error_signature) fingerprints is bounded by
   (number of distinct keepers) × (number of distinct tools each
   exercises) × (number of distinct normalized error families per
   tool). At production scale (~tens of keepers, low tens of tools per
   keeper, low tens of stable error families per tool) the cardinality
   is at most low thousands — unbounded accumulation across process
   lifetime is acceptable. *)

(* Threshold tuned against the 2026-05-19 1000-line system_log sample
   (4 distinct (keeper, tool) pairs × 2 repetitions each). With the
   on_tool_error hook firing once per failure (no 1→3 retry ladder
   bundled inside one event), threshold 5 means the operator sees the
   first ERROR plus four DEBUG-demoted intermediates before the durable
   Threshold_silence ERROR fires. *)
let default_silence_threshold = 5

(* Byte cap on the normalized signature. The first 80 bytes of a
   typical OAS tool error carry the error-class prefix and a short
   stable description (the high-signal portion). Variable payloads
   (timestamps, paths, request IDs, PR numbers) that follow are
   deliberately dropped from the fingerprint so the dedupe layer can
   converge. *)

(* Fingerprint key. [keeper_name], [tool_name], and [error_signature]
   are concatenated with a null separator. The separator avoids the
   collision risk of straight concatenation when one component happens
   to be a prefix of another component's neighbour (e.g. tool name
   "ab" + signature "cd" vs tool name "a" + signature "bcd"). *)
