(** Keeper_voice_local — Local voice session management for keepers.

    Provides a singleton Voice_session_manager backed by the local filesystem,
    eliminating the need for an external Voice MCP server for session tracking.
    TTS (agent_speak) still uses direct HTTP endpoints (ElevenLabs, etc).

    OS thread, so [ref] read/write cannot race. No Eio.Mutex needed.

    subsequent calls to [get_session_manager] return the cached value.
