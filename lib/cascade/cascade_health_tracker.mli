    measured in minutes or hours; honoring those literally would silently
    promote a transient 429 into a long blackout.  Anything that exceeds
    this clamp should be classified as {!record_hard_quota} by the

    on the same degraded provider before any recovery window has elapsed.
    Default 5.0 (5s) — shorter than {!soft_rate_limit_cooldown_sec} because
    capacity backpressure is a short-window signal (peers usually recover
    faster than 429-bearing providers), but non-zero so the cascade does
    not immediately re-select the just-rejected provider.

    full distribution.  100 samples cover ~5–15 minutes of activity for
    a busy provider while staying small enough to sort cheaply on every

    Behaves like {!record_failure} for cooldown / weight purposes — a
    provider whose outputs are consistently unusable should be skipped —
    but is counted separately in [provider_info.rejected_in_window] so
    the dashboard can distinguish "provider down" from "provider returns
    garbage".

    Prior to 0.160.0 this path called {!record_success} (the response
    technically arrived), which silently masked gate drift: a provider
    could rank 100% healthy while every call fell through to the next

(** Record a provider call that failed with a hard-quota error (balance
    depleted, monthly quota reached, resource exhausted — classified
    upstream via [Llm_provider.Retry.is_hard_quota]).

    ({!hard_quota_cooldown_sec}, default 1h) with no threshold — a
    provider whose account is out of credit will not recover within the
    regular [cooldown_sec] window, and weighted_random re-selection just

(** Record a transient HTTP 429 (rate-limit) response.

    Unlike {!record_failure}, a single soft rate-limit triggers an
    immediate short cooldown so the cascade can fall over to the next
    candidate within the same turn instead of returning to the same
    provider on the next selection tick.  No threshold applies.

    [retry_after_s] is the value parsed from the upstream HTTP
    [Retry-After] header (RFC 7231: integer seconds or HTTP-date).
    When present, cooldown is set to [min retry_after_s
    soft_rate_limit_max_clamp_sec]; otherwise cooldown defaults to
    {!soft_rate_limit_cooldown_sec}.  Negative or zero values fall back
    to the default.  Caller is responsible for upgrading sustained 429
    bursts to {!record_hard_quota} when appropriate (e.g. monthly quota
    boundaries) — this function intentionally never extends past
    [soft_rate_limit_max_clamp_sec] regardless of header value.

    cascade skips the provider for the rest of the cycle without waiting
