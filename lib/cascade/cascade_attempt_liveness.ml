(** Cascade attempt-level streaming liveness gate (RFC-0022 PR-1/4).

    Implementation of the decision table in
    [docs/rfc/RFC-0022-cascade-attempt-liveness.md] §4.5.

    Pure FSM. No IO, no clock read, no fiber. Caller (PR-2) supplies
    monotonic timestamps via {!event} and consumes {!output} for
    Prometheus / log emission. *)

type budget = {
  ttft_max : float;
  inter_chunk_max : float;
  attempt_wall_max : float;
}

(* §4.1 Recommended starting points. Final values must be empirically
   calibrated against [scripts/diag-keeper-cycle.sh] output after
   PR-2 wiring is enabled in [observe] mode. *)

(* Decision table — RFC-0022 §4.5.

   Invariants enforced here:
   - S1: every chunk except Done advances last_chunk_at.
   - S2: Done in Streaming → Success terminal; no further state moves.
   - T1: Heartbeat / Thinking_delta both count as motion.
   - L2: TTFT and inter-chunk checks fire before wall when both expire
         on the same tick (caller of cascade_fsm gets the most specific
         kill class; matches §1 invariant L2 "no double kill"). *)
