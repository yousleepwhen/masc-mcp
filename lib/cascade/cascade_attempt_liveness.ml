(** Cascade attempt-level streaming liveness gate (RFC-0022 PR-1/4).

    Implementation of the decision table in
    [docs/rfc/RFC-0022-cascade-attempt-liveness.md] §4.5.

    Pure FSM. No IO, no clock read, no fiber. Caller (PR-2) supplies
    monotonic timestamps via {!event} and consumes {!output} for
    Prometheus / log emission. *)

   successful sample for the concrete provider/model candidate. Later attempts
   are tuned from successful TTFT/inter-chunk/wall samples in
   [Cascade_attempt_liveness_config]. *)

    Pure FSM stays IO-free; side effects live in the recorder. *)

(* Decision table — RFC-0022 §4.5.

   Invariants enforced here:
   - S1: every chunk except Done advances last_chunk_at.
   - S2: Done in Streaming → Success terminal; no further state moves.
   - T1: Heartbeat / Thinking_delta both count as motion.
   - L2: TTFT and inter-chunk checks fire before wall when both expire
         on the same tick (caller of cascade_fsm gets the most specific
         kill class; matches §1 invariant L2 "no double kill"). Wall still
         applies in Awaiting, so a shorter attempt wall can kill a no-first-byte
         attempt before the TTFT ceiling. *)
