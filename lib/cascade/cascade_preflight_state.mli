(** Cascade preflight unhealthy-skip escalation state.

    Tracks repeated [preflight skipped N unhealthy ...] events per
    (tier_group, provider, reason) fingerprint. After [threshold_disable]
    consecutive skips of the same fingerprint, the provider is registered
    in an in-memory disabled list and a single ERROR-class escalation is
    emitted (instead of a WARN per skip).

    A successful health recovery (caller invokes
    [reset_on_health_recovery]) clears all fingerprints for that provider
    and removes it from the disabled list, emitting one INFO transition.

    {1 Design notes}

    - Routing semantics are preserved: the disabled list is advisory.
      Callers may still attempt the provider; this module only changes
      the {e log-level cadence}, not routing.
    - State is in-memory only (per-process). Survives across cascade
      attempts in one keeper-server lifetime; rebuilt at restart.
    - Closed sum types only, no catch-all match.

    [threshold_disable] (n is the consecutive count, n=threshold) — the

    to the disabled list. Subsequent matching records return
    [`Already_disabled] until [reset_on_health_recovery] is called. *)
