(** Per-keeper authorization bridging for runtime MCP policies.
    Extracted from [cascade_transport.ml] (godfile decomp). Two
    helpers:

    - [cli_tool_a_can_auth_keeper_bound_runtime_mcp] — predicate that
      decides whether the Codex CLI route can mint a per-keeper
      Authorization header for a bound-actor MCP policy.

    - [bridged_runtime_mcp_policy_for_agent] — the RFC-0058 §2.4
      capability-driven projection: strip inbound HTTP headers,
      re-inject MASC identity headers, and source the Authorization
      header from the bound-actor branch or the inbound MASC entry. *)

module Authorization = Cascade_transport_authorization
module Mcp_policy_helpers = Cascade_transport_mcp_policy_helpers

let cli_tool_a_can_auth_keeper_bound_runtime_mcp ~agent_name policy =
  Authorization.runtime_mcp_policy_uses_bound_actor_tools policy
  && Option.is_some (Authorization.per_keeper_authorization_header ~agent_name)
;;

(* RFC-0058 §2.4 capability-driven projection.

   Header lifecycle (in this order, no early exits):
   1. [runtime_mcp_policy_without_http_headers] strips ALL HTTP headers
      from every [Http_server] in the policy. This step is
      unconditional — any inbound [Authorization] is gone before any
      decision below.
   2. [runtime_mcp_policy_with_masc_agent_name] re-injects only the
      non-secret MASC identity headers.
   3. The [Authorization] header is then sourced from one of two
      branches:
        - if [runtime_mcp_policy_uses_bound_actor_tools policy = true],
          from [Auth.load_raw_token] via
          [per_keeper_authorization_header ~agent_name];
        - else, read from the *inbound* policy's [name = "masc"]
          [Http_server] entry via [authorization_header_from_policy]
          (which reads [policy.servers], not [stripped.servers], so it
          recovers the MASC bearer that the caller provided).
      When either branch yields [None], the returned policy carries no
      [Authorization] header — there is no fall-through to the inbound
      policy's non-masc headers, which were removed in step 1.

   Invariant: this function is only reached from the dispatch site when the
   provider-tool policy says per-keeper bridging is required, i.e. the runtime
   cannot carry arbitrary per-request HTTP headers.  Body is intentionally
   identical in semantics to the prior [codex_runtime_mcp_policy_for_agent] —
   the rename removes the provider-name leak from the dispatch site without
   altering behavior.

   A future adapter with [requires_per_keeper_bridging = true] but
   different transport semantics (e.g. native per-keeper header
   injection) should be handled by an explicit dispatch arm at the
   call site, not by adding a new flag parameter here — adding such
   a flag now would introduce a code path no current provider exercises
   and risks a silent header-preservation regression (see Copilot
   review of PR #14885). *)
