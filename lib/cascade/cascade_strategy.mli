(** Pluggable cascade strategy — selects and orders provider candidates.

    A strategy is a pure transformation that takes the raw candidate list
    plus runtime signals (health, capacity, wall clock) and returns the
    ordered subset to attempt in a single cascade cycle.  It never calls
    IO; it never mutates state.  When a cycle exhausts without success,
    the caller re-invokes the strategy for the next cycle (optionally
    after a backoff sleep); the strategy can return a different ordering
    because health and capacity signals may have changed.

    Phase A (S1–S4) is purely stateless.  Phase B introduces three
    additional kinds — [Priority_tier], [Sticky], [Round_robin] — that
    consult per-cascade-name state owned by {!Cascade_state}.  The
    ordering function remains read-only; mutations happen via the
    explicit {!record_choice} hook the cascade caller invokes after a
    successful attempt.
