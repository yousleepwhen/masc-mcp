(** Pluggable cascade strategy — selects and orders provider candidates.

    A strategy is a pure transformation that takes the raw candidate list
    plus runtime signals (health, capacity, wall clock) and returns the
    ordered subset to attempt in a single cascade cycle.  It never calls
    IO; it never mutates state.  When a cycle exhausts without success,
    the caller re-invokes the strategy for the next cycle (optionally
    after a backoff sleep); the strategy can return a different ordering
    because health and capacity signals may have changed.

    The shipped runtime supports two operator-visible strategies:
    [Failover] and [Priority_tier].  Older experimental strategies were
    retired from the public ADT so they cannot be selected accidentally
    by config, tests, or internal callers.

        is "active" iff at least one of its providers survives the
        filter, otherwise the cycle yields the empty list and the

(** {1 Candidate adapter}

    Strategies read candidate identity from the health-tracker key
    (typically provider-scoped) and capacity key (typically [base_url]).
    We expose an adapter so tests can drive the strategy with simple
    in-memory records, and production wires it to
    [Llm_provider.Provider_config.t].  The adapter is resolution-time
    data; strategies do not mutate it. *)

    subset of [candidates] to attempt in [cycle].  Returns the empty

    report [process_available = 0] for S2), in which case the caller
    should either advance to the next cycle with a backoff or report
    [Cascade_exhausted].

    When a capacity domain is known full, the returned list keeps at most
    one representative for that full domain in the cycle. This preserves a
    concrete capacity-backpressure error while avoiding repeated attempts
