(** MASC Event_bus publishers for runtime events.

    Publishes MASC coordination events (broadcasts, heartbeats, board
    posts, task transitions, keeper lifecycle, audit) to the MASC-owned
    Event_bus. Events follow dot-separated snake_case naming per OAS
    Custom-name convention: [masc.broadcast], [masc.heartbeat],
    [masc.keeper.lifecycle], ...

    Every publish routes to [Masc_event_bus.get ()] so the OAS/MASC
    layer boundary is preserved. OAS's [event_bus.mli:103-107]
    explicitly warns against publishing domain events onto OAS's bus.

    Wire format on SSE output keeps colon separators ("masc.broadcast")
    for dashboard compatibility — the translation is done by the SSE
    relay, not here.

    @since 2.90.0 (bus-separated since 2.353.0) *)

(* Route every publish to the MASC-owned bus. This closes the OAS boundary
   violation where MASC was publishing Custom("masc:...") onto OAS's shared
   bus. *)

(** {1 Keeper Lifecycle Events} *)

(** Publish a keeper keepalive lifecycle event.

    Event names are pinned by
    {!Keeper_lifecycle_events.all_event_names}, which covers both the
    custom verbs (\[started\] / \[reconciled\] / \[restarted\] /
    \[dead_cleaned\] / \[self_preservation\] / \[paused_pruned\]) and
    the phase-derived names (\[stopped\] / \[crashed\] / \[dead\] /
    \[running\]).

    Issue #8575: the previous docstring listed only five names, so
    operators silently missed the cleanup and self-healing events
    (\[reconciled\] / \[dead_cleaned\] / \[self_preservation\] /
    \[paused_pruned\] / \[admission_denied\]) — exactly the events that signal supervisor
    recovery actions where observability matters most. Subscribe to
    {!Keeper_lifecycle_events.all_event_names} to receive the full
    stream; the sync test in [test_types.ml ::
    lifecycle_events_ssot] asserts every literal still emitted by
    [Keeper_supervisor] / [Keeper_keepalive] lives in the SSOT. *)
(* #8856 / #8605 family: [event] is now the unified
   [Keeper_lifecycle_events.lifecycle_event] variant -- typos at the
   16 supervisor/keepalive call sites fail to compile. JSON wire
   format ("event" + optional "phase" field) is preserved
   bit-identically:
     - Custom_event { verb; phase = None }  -> event=verb, phase=null
     - Custom_event { verb; phase = Some p } -> event=verb, phase=p
     - Phase_event p                          -> event=p, phase=p
   The legacy ?phase optional argument is folded into the variant. *)

(** Publish a structured keeper-Dead event.

    after [restart_count >= max_restarts]. Operators should treat this as
    actionable: the supervisor will NOT retry the keeper. Independent from
    the [event="dead"] entry on [masc.keeper.lifecycle] (which is unstructured
    free-form [detail]) so subscribers can filter on a stable topic and pull
    the structured fields directly. Topic: [masc.keeper.dead]. *)
