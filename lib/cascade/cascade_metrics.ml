(** Cascade_metrics — Prometheus emit helpers for cascade routing observability.

   a provider that was not literally declared in cascade.toml — most
   commonly via alias expansion ([cli_tool_a:auto] -> a concrete model)
   or provider_filter fallback widening, but in pathological cases a
   genuine configuration drift where keeper turns route to a
   provider the operator never approved.

   Previously this was WARN-log only at the call site; operators had
   no way to alert on leak rate without scraping logs.  Bumping the
   counter by the number of leaked entries (not just calls) means a
   dashboard can show "leak provider-hits per second per cascade",
   distinguishing a single chronic alias from a sudden cascade-wide
   widening.

   Cardinality: cascades (~10) = ~10 series.  Provider-kind label

   rejection: missing route targets (a [\[routes\]] entry points at a
   profile that doesn't exist) and unknown route keys (a [\[routes\]]
   key isn't in the known_route_keys allowlist — typo or deprecated
   key).  Iter 5's [serving_last_known_good_total{reason}] tells
   operators that validation failed but does not split the cause; the
   actual error reason was only present in the rejection error
   strings.  These two are by far the most common operator-actionable
   schema mistakes; split them out so dashboards can show typo-rate
   vs missing-profile-rate as separate time series.

   Bumped by [count] per validate_path_result invocation rather than
   +1 per call (same shape as resolve_provider_leak): a single typo
   commit can land multiple missing targets at once, and dashboards
   benefit from seeing the magnitude.

   Cardinality: 2 (error_type values).  No cascade name label —
   validate_path_result runs against a single cascade.toml, and
   adding the raw route key as a label would explode cardinality
   on operator typos.  Detail belongs in the rejection error string,
   not the metric. *)

                                  (snapshot unavailable OR unknown
                                  cascade name in snapshot)

     no_callable_providers     — final filter step left the resolved
                                  list empty

   Iter 7's [on_resolve_provider_leak] observes the OK arm only;
   these Error arms were the symmetric blind spot.  When keeper turns
   experience a sudden spike of "cascade X failed at resolve", the
   existing [masc_cascade_fallbacks_total] tells operators THAT
   fallback fired but not WHY the primary failed — that detail used
   to live only in the WARN log line at the call site (and in some
   arms not even that).

                                   rejected (e.g. a newly added
                                   profile fails its own validation
                                   while the rest of the catalog

                                   silently absent — the operator

(* [apply_provider_filter] (non-strict) is a fail-OPEN filter: when

   instead of rejecting.  The strict variant
   [apply_provider_filter_strict] is fail-CLOSED (returns Error,
   counted by [on_resolve_failure ~reason:"provider_filter_rejected"]
   in iter 10), but the non-strict path was silent except for a WARN
   line at the call site.

   A non-zero rate here means the operator's filter expressed an
   intent ("use only provider_a for this cascade") that the runtime
   silently widened to "use any provider in this cascade", with
   security / budget / SLA implications.  Different signal from
   iter 7's [on_resolve_provider_leak] (which compares

   operator-provided CLI override lists.  The per-cascade fan-out
   amount was silent: operators saw one line in cascade.toml but the
   runtime cascading list was N entries, and a change in the registry
   would silently shift the effective candidate count without any
   dashboard signal.

   Bumped by [fanout] = [output_count - input_count] per call so a
   [rate()] tracks "extra candidates synthesized per cascade per

   to the unfiltered [entries] list — same shape as iter 12's
   [provider_filter_widening], one stage later in the pipeline.

   A non-zero rate here means [Cascade_health_tracker] judged every
   provider in this cascade unhealthy, yet keeper turns continue to
   route on the same list as if the health tracker had said nothing.

   (false negatives across the board) or every provider is actually
   down and the cascade should fail closed.

   histogram, so dashboards saw duration distribution but no entry
   rate and no reason attribution.  A spike of "all providers down"
   downstream (iter 18 ordering_health_widening) could be driven by
   any of the four reasons, and operators had no way to distinguish
   "global outage shapes" (hard_quota across providers) from
   "single-provider flap" (failure_threshold on one key).

                               catalog has zero validated names
                               (cascade.toml load / validate fault).
                               The runtime preserves the configured
                               route target.
     target_not_in_catalog  — route_target points at a profile that
                               is not in the validated catalog.
                               Typically a typo or a profile removed
                               from cascade.toml without updating the
                               [routes] table.

   Distinct from iter 9 [route_config_error{error_type}]: that
   counter ticks during [validate_path_result] when the catalog is
   built; this counter ticks during runtime route RESOLUTION when
   [cascade_name_for_use] is called (e.g. on every keeper turn).
   The two windows can disagree: validate_path_result may have
   built a valid catalog (no schema error), but a subsequent
   [cascade_name_for_use] call may still hit the unvalidated arm if
   a downstream caller threads in a stale config_path.

   The third arm (None — no route configured for this use) stays
   silent: normal "operator did not set a route" path.

     invalid_value         — [target_of_route_value] returned None.
                              The value is not a declarative route

                              string after trimming.

   The silent drop means the [routes] table looks valid from a
   parser perspective (no Error raised) but a route the operator
   declared just doesn't make it into the catalog.  Downstream
   route resolution then falls back to iter-30
   [route_resolve_fallback] — but the iter-30 counter can't
