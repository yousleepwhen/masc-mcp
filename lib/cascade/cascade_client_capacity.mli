(** Client-declared per-endpoint capacity for providers that do not
    expose a slot/capacity probe (ollama HTTP, CLI transports, etc.).

    [Cascade_throttle] is Discovery-driven and currently only speaks
    to llama-server via [/slots].  Ollama on port 11434 has no slot
    concept, but users nonetheless want at most one concurrent call
    so two keepers don't trash the GPU.  This module is the MASC-side
    semaphore: a declared [max_concurrent], an atomic active counter,
    and a [capacity] query that returns the same [capacity_info]
    record so [Cascade_strategy.signal_ctx.capacity] can consult a
    single uniform view.

    The counter is maintained by explicit [try_acquire] / release
    pairs at the cascade call site.  No timeout, no queueing, no
    blocking — if no permit is free, [try_acquire] returns [Full]
    and the strategy's capacity filter will have already skipped this
    endpoint in its ordering.  Defense-in-depth: both the filter and
    the acquire check the same counter, so a race between filter and
    acquire simply yields a [Full] that the cascade treats as typed
    capacity backpressure before trying the next candidate.

(** {1 Registration} *)

val register : url:string -> max_concurrent:int -> unit
(** Register a client-declared capacity for [url].  Idempotent:
    re-registering the same [url] with the same [max_concurrent] is a
    no-op; changing [max_concurrent] updates the cap and preserves
    the current active count.  Caller is responsible for passing
    [max_concurrent >= 1]; values [<= 0] are silently clamped to 1
    to avoid starvation.

    Typical callers:
    - module init parses [MASC_CLIENT_CAPACITY]
    - [Keeper_turn_driver] registers HTTP-probe-capable candidates
      gated on provider-kind probe capability *)

val registered_urls : unit -> string list
(** Snapshot of currently-registered URLs.  Test helper. *)

val snapshot : unit -> (string * Cascade_throttle.capacity_info) list
(** Atomic snapshot of every registered URL paired with the current
    [capacity_info] (total, active, available).  Used by the
    dashboard projection to surface client-declared semaphores
    (ollama HTTP, CLI sentinels) in a single uniform table.

    The snapshot is taken under the registry mutex so all entries
    are read consistently with respect to register/unregister, but
    the [process_active] count is read atomically per-entry so
    concurrent acquires/releases between entries can produce
    slightly stale counts.  Callers treat this as observability
    data, not a transactional view.

    @since 0.9.9 *)

val unregister_all : unit -> unit
(** Remove every registration.  Test helper. *)

(** {1 CLI sentinel auto-registration} *)

val auto_register_cli_for_candidates :
  capacity_keys:string list ->
  unit
(** For each capacity key that looks like a CLI sentinel
    (heuristic: starts with [cli:]) and is not yet registered,
    register it with the default CLI concurrency
    (env [MASC_CLI_MAX_CONCURRENT], fallback [1]).

    Idempotent.  CLI providers (Cli_tool_d / Cli_tool_b / Cli_tool_a)
    have an empty [base_url] so the cascade caller derives a
    sentinel like [cli:cli_tool_d] for capacity key purposes;
    registering that sentinel here gives the strategy a uniform
    [signal_ctx.capacity] view across HTTP and CLI providers.

    @since 0.9.8 *)

val auto_register_cli_with_override :
  capacity_keys:string list ->
  max_concurrent:int ->
  unit
(** Like {!auto_register_cli_for_candidates} but with an explicit
    [max_concurrent] that overrides the env default.  Used by the
    per-cascade [<name>_cli_max_concurrent] field.

    Idempotent and only touches keys that look like CLI sentinels
    and are not already registered.

    @since 0.9.8 *)

(** {1 Capacity query} *)

val capacity : string -> Cascade_throttle.capacity_info option
(** [capacity url] returns the current [Cascade_throttle.capacity_info]
    for a client-declared URL.  Returns [None] if [url] was never
    registered.  The [source] field is always
    [Llm_provider.Provider_throttle.Fallback] (no Discovery input).

    The [process_active] and [process_available] values reflect the
    atomic counter; [total] = registered [max_concurrent];
    [process_queue_length] is always 0 (no queueing in Phase 1). *)

(** {1 Acquire / release} *)

type release = unit -> unit
(** Idempotent release thunk.  Calling it twice is safe; the second
    call is a no-op. *)

type acquire_result =
  | Acquired of release
  | Full of { retry_after_s : float option }
  | Unregistered
(** Result of a non-blocking acquire.

    - [Acquired release] — slot obtained; caller must call [release]
      exactly once.
    - [Full { retry_after_s }] — [url] is registered but all slots are
      in use.  [retry_after_s] hints when the caller should retry.
    - [Unregistered] — [url] has no declared capacity; caller should
      treat this as "no client cap, go ahead". *)

val try_acquire : string -> acquire_result
(** Non-blocking acquire.  See {!acquire_result} for outcome semantics.

    @since 0.9.6 *)

val is_registered : string -> bool
(** [is_registered url] is [true] iff [url] has a declared capacity.
    Convenience for disambiguating [Unregistered] from [Full]. *)
