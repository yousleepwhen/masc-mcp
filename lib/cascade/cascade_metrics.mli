(** Cascade_metrics — Prometheus emit helpers for cascade routing observability. *)

val on_decision : cascade_name:string -> decision_label:string -> unit
val on_fallback : cascade_name:string -> reason:string -> unit
val on_exhausted : cascade_name:string -> reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the cascade exhaustion counter when all tiers failed.
    [reason] is classified from the last error:
    [accept_rejected], [http_error], [cli_required],
    [network_error], [timeout], [provider_terminal],
    [provider_failure], or [no_providers]. *)
val on_phase_override : phase:string -> from_cascade:string -> to_cascade:string -> unit

val on_profile_discovery : path:string -> unit
(** Tick the profile discovery counter.  [path] must be one of
    [declarative], [declarative_error], [declarative_missing],
    [declarative_parse_error].  See [cascade_catalog_runtime.ml]
    [discover_profile_names]. *)

val on_declarative_parse_error : unit -> unit
(** Tick the declarative parse error counter once per discovery call
    that returned [Error _] from the declarative adapter.  The
    individual error bodies are surfaced via WARN logs at the call
    site. *)

val on_parallel_validation : result:string -> unit
(** Tick the parallel-validation counter for one [validate_path_result]
    invocation.  [result] must be one of [ok], [mismatch],
    [adapter_error], [no_decl]. *)

val on_toml_read_race : unit -> unit
(** Tick the TOML read-race counter once per [load_toml_in_memory]
    call where the cascade.toml mtime drifted between the pre-stat
    and post-stat samples, or the file vanished between samples.
    The loader still returns fresh content but skips the cache
    update so the next call re-converges. *)

val on_serving_last_known_good : reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the serving-last-known-good counter for one [inspect_active]
    invocation that returned [Serving_last_known_good].  [reason] must
    be one of [path_unresolved], [validation_failed],
    [stale_rejection_cached]. *)

val on_degraded_recovery : unit -> unit
(** Tick once per [inspect_active] call that transitions FROM a
    degraded state (either [Serving_last_known_good] from iter 5 or
    [Validated_with_rejections] from iter 11) back to [Validated]
    (operator fixed the cascade.toml fault).  Originally named
    [on_lkg_recovery] in iter 5 when only the LKG case existed;
    renamed in iter 16 after iter 11 broadened the
    [prev_was_failing] detection to include partial-rejection
    recovery. *)

val on_profile_candidate_drop : cascade:string -> reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the per-cascade candidate drop counter at [validate_profile_static]
    when [Cascade_config.parse_weighted_entry_diag] rejects an entry.
    [reason] must be one of [unregistered_scheme], [unavailable_scheme],
    [invalid_syntax]. *)

val on_resolve_provider_leak : cascade:string -> leak_count:int -> unit
(** Tick the resolve-leak counter at [resolve_named_providers] when
    the returned Provider_config.t list contains entries not present
    in the parsed declared profile.  Bumps by [leak_count] (number of
    leaked entries observed in this single resolve call); a [leak_count]
    of zero is a no-op so callers can call unconditionally. *)

val on_route_config_error : error_type:string -> count:int -> unit
(** Tick the route schema-error counter at [validate_path_result] for
    each rejection class folded into [top_errors].  [error_type] must
    be one of [missing_target_profile] (a [\[routes\]] entry points
    at a profile that doesn't exist) or [unknown_route_key] (a
    [\[routes\]] key isn't in the known_route_keys allowlist —
    typo or deprecated key).  Bumps by [count] (number of errors
    of that type in this single validate call); a [count] of zero
    is a no-op so callers can call unconditionally. *)

val on_resolve_failure : cascade:string -> reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the resolve-failure counter for one [resolve_named_providers]
    or [resolve_named_providers_strict] invocation that returned
    [Error _].  [reason] must be one of [lookup_failed],
    [provider_filter_rejected], [no_callable_providers].  [cascade]
    uses the normalized cascade name when available, or the raw
    cascade_name argument when normalization itself failed
    ([lookup_failed] arm). *)

val on_validated_with_rejections : reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the validated-with-rejections counter for one [inspect_active]
    invocation that returned [Validated_with_rejections].  [reason]
    must be one of [fresh_partial_rejection] (validate_path_result
    newly produced a partial rejection on this call) or
    [stale_partial_rejection_cached] (same-mtime cache replay of a
    previously-cached partial rejection). *)

val on_provider_filter_widening : cascade:string -> unit
(** Tick the provider-filter widening counter for one
    [apply_provider_filter] (non-strict) invocation whose filter
    matched no provider in the declared set, causing the function
    to fall back to the unfiltered list.  A non-zero rate signals
    the operator-supplied filter is being silently widened with
    security / budget / SLA implications. *)

val on_auto_expansion_fanout : cascade:string -> fanout:int -> unit
(** Tick the [provider:auto] fan-out counter at
    [expand_weighted_entries] by [fanout] (= output_count -
    input_count).  [fanout=0] is a documented no-op so callers
    invoke unconditionally.  A [rate()] tracks how many extra
    candidates per cascade per second are synthesized by auto
    expansion. *)

val on_ordering_health_widening : cascade:string -> unit
(** Tick the ordering-step health-widening counter at
    [order_weighted_entries] when [Cascade_health_tracker] has cooled
    every provider (active = []) and the function falls back to the
    unfiltered [entries] list.  A non-zero rate signals the health
    tracker judged every provider in this cascade unhealthy yet
    keeper turns continue to route — either the health tracker is
    wrong or the cascade should fail closed. *)

val on_provider_cooldown : provider:string -> reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the per-provider cooldown-entry counter at
    [Cascade_health_tracker.record] when a fresh cooldown_until is
    set.  [reason] must be one of [failure_threshold],
    [soft_rate_limit], [hard_quota], [terminal_failure].  Distinct
    from the existing [keeper_provider_block_duration_sec]
    histogram, which captures duration distribution but not entry
    rate or reason. *)

val on_strategy_starvation_guard : cascade:string -> strategy:string -> unit
(** Tick the strategy-starvation-guard counter when
    [Cascade_strategy.order_candidates] falls through with the
    pre-capacity-filter candidate list because every candidate
    reported capacity=0.  [strategy] must be [priority_tier]. *)

val on_default_label_fallback : cascade:string -> reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the default-label-fallback counter at
    [Cascade_runtime.default_model_strings] when label resolution
    falls back to the hardcoded local default.  [reason] must be one
    of [no_execution_labels] (no execution lane configured at all)
    or [local_cascade_no_local] (local-only cascade with no local
    candidate labels). *)

val on_max_context_fallback : site:string -> unit
(** Tick the max-context fallback counter when [Cascade_runtime]
    resolves [fallback_context_window] instead of a configured
    value.  [site] must be one of [label_no_provider_name],
    [label_unregistered_scheme], [primary_no_available],
    [cascade_max_no_available]. *)

val on_discovered_context_below_floor : unit -> unit
(** Tick the discovered-context floor-violation counter at
    [Cascade_runtime.effective_discovered_ctx] when a per-label
    discovered context_window is below [context_floor] (4_096) and
    the function falls back to the static registry value.  A
    non-zero rate signals a discovery-API misbehavior for at least
    one provider. *)

val on_context_capability_drift : provider:string -> unit
(** Tick the context-capability-drift counter at
    [Cascade_runtime.static_context_of_entry] when the provider
    registry [max_context] disagrees with the capability table's
    [max_context_tokens] (caps_ctx > entry.max_context).  Signals
    operator updated one of two ground truths and forgot the
    other. *)

(* RFC-0167: [on_llama_model_not_discovered] was removed when the
   product-named arm in [Cascade_config.resolve_label_context] was
   dropped. *)

val on_route_resolve_fallback : reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the runtime route-resolution fallback counter at
    [Cascade_routes.cascade_name_for_use] when a configured route
    target cannot be honored.  [reason] must be one of
    [catalog_unvalidated] (no validated catalog names available)
    or [target_not_in_catalog] (declared target missing from the
    catalog).  Distinct from iter-9 [route_config_error] which
    ticks during catalog validation. *)

val on_capability_mismatch : count:int -> unit
(** Tick the capability-mismatch counter at
    catalog validation when capability mismatch detection returns a
    non-empty list.
    Bumped by [count] so a deploy that introduces N broken edges
    spikes proportionally; [count=0] is a no-op so callers invoke
    unconditionally.  Counter complement to the existing
    [metric_cascade_fallback_cycle_detected_total] (already covers
    cycles); together they observe the two RFC-0055/0058 fallback
    graph invariants. *)

val on_route_binding_dropped : reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the route-binding-dropped counter at
    [Cascade_routes.route_bindings_from_json] when an entry in the
    [routes] table is silently dropped.  [reason] must be one of
    [invalid_value] (not a declarative route table with [target]) or
    [empty_key_or_target] (target or key trimmed to empty string). *)

val on_weighted_item_dropped : reason:string -> unit
(** Tick the weighted-item-dropped counter when retired flat-profile
    parsing silently drops an entry.
    [reason] must be one of [missing_or_empty_model] or
    [invalid_value_type].  Also doubles as an RFC-0066 Phase 4
    migration tracker — 5-layer cascade.toml never hits this
    path, so non-zero rate flags legacy fixtures. *)

(* RFC-0149 §3.3 sunset closeout: [on_resolve_live_fallback] +
   [metric_resolve_live_fallback] removed.  Their carrier function
   ([Keeper_cascade_profile.resolve_live_with_catalog] silent fallback)
   was deleted in the same closeout; every caller now consumes
   [resolve_live_with_catalog_result] and surfaces [Error (`Unresolved _)]
   on the operator-visible path. *)

val on_fallback_hint_invalid : unit -> unit
(** Tick the fallback-hint-invalid counter at
    [Keeper_cascade_profile.fallback_cascade_for] when the named
    [fallback_cascade] target is not in the live catalog and the
    function silently returns None (operator-declared fallback has
    no effect).  Runtime complement to iter-32
    [capability_mismatch] which checks the same graph at
    catalog-build time. *)

val on_partial_eio_context : unit -> unit
(** Tick the partial-Eio-context counter at
    [Cascade_runtime.refresh_local_discovery_if_possible] when
    only one of [Eio.Switch.t] / [Eio.Net.t] is available.  The
    existing WARN-once dedups to one log line per process; this
    counter ticks every hit so the rate is alertable even after
    the WARN was suppressed. *)

val on_discovery_refresh_exception : unit -> unit
(** Tick the discovery-refresh-exception counter at
    [Cascade_runtime.refresh_local_discovery_if_possible] when
    [refresh_llama_endpoints] raises a non-cancellation
    exception.  The exception is swallowed and the function
    returns false; this counter makes the swallow rate
    alertable. *)

val on_profile_registration_failure : unit -> unit
(** Tick the profile-registration-failure counter when declarative
    catalog loading calls
    [Cascade_capability_profile.register_declared_profiles_from_json]
    returns an Error.  The Error is logged but the catalog
    continues loading without the declared profiles; this counter
    surfaces the silent registration gap. *)

val on_cascade_invariant_violation : unit -> unit
(** Tick the cascade-invariant-violation counter at
    [Keeper_turn_driver]'s [Accept] arm inside the
    [Accept_rejected] FSM branch ("should be unreachable" defensive
    code).  Steady-state value must be ZERO; non-zero indicates a
    real FSM contract violation. *)

val on_cascade_metrics_eviction : unit -> unit
(** Tick the cascade-metrics LRU eviction counter at
    [Cascade_observation] when the in-memory cascade-counter
    table evicts an LRU entry to admit a new cascade name.  High
    rate signals cascade-name churn — either raise
    [cascade_max_keys] or canonicalize synthesized names. *)

val on_max_tokens_clamped : unit -> unit
(** Tick when a cascade-config, fallback, or internal keeper override
    max_tokens budget is reduced to the resolved cascade output ceiling.
    Repeated clamps are counted here even when the corresponding WARN log is
    deduplicated. *)

val on_cascade_audit_failure : stage:string -> unit
(** Tick the cascade-audit subsystem failure counter at
    [Cascade_observation].  [stage] must be one of
    [store_creation] (JSONL store init failed) or [append]
    (single record append failed).  Audit subsystem failures
    don't break keeper turns but compromise post-incident
    analysis. *)

val on_local_context_clamped : unit -> unit
(** Tick the local-context-clamped counter at
    [Cascade_runtime.clamp_context_for_pure_local_labels] when a
    cascade with only local-provider labels has its
    [max_context] silently reduced to [small_local_floor].
    Symmetric to DD-020 [max_tokens_ceiling_violation]
    (response-budget side). *)

val all_cascade_counters : (string * string) list
(** SSOT list of every cascade counter in this module, paired with
    its Prometheus [help] text.  Used by [register_all] and by the
    iter-50 cascade TOML validation coverage test
    to enumerate every metric without re-listing them.  Help text
    defaults to the metric name for counters that don't need
    operator-facing description; the iter-44 / iter-48 backfill
    populates richer help for the 17 most actionable counters. *)

val register_all : unit -> unit
(** Pre-register every counter in [all_cascade_counters] with
    [Prometheus.register_counter] so process startup exposes them
    at /metrics with zero value.  Idempotent: register_counter is
    a no-op if the metric is already known.  Intended to be
    called once from the module-load toplevel; see the
    [let () = register_all ()] at the bottom of
    [cascade_metrics.ml]. *)
