(** Pool router — maps keepers to pools and handles pool-level fallback.

    Implements the Bulkhead pattern: each keeper is assigned to a
    primary pool.  When the primary pool is fully in cooldown, the
    router falls through to lower tiers (Tier1 → Tier2 → Emergency).

    @since Phase 1 — Resilience Architecture *)

    [f] is called with a provider key selected from the primary pool.
    If the primary pool's providers are all in cooldown, falls through
    to the next tier.  Returns [Error `All_pools_exhausted] only when
    all pools including Emergency have been exhausted. *)
