(** Ollama [/api/ps] capacity probe.

    Phase A introduced {!Cascade_client_capacity} as a process-local
    semaphore for endpoints {!Cascade_throttle} cannot probe (ollama
    HTTP, CLI transports, etc.).  The Phase A semaphore is accurate
    for *this* OCaml process, but it cannot see request load from
    other clients (other keepers, dashboard, manual curl) hitting
    the same ollama server.

    Phase C adds a real server-side probe via Ollama's [/api/ps]
    endpoint, which lists currently-loaded models.  When a model is
    loaded, ollama is "warm"; when [models] is empty, it is "cold"
    and the next request will pay a model-load latency hit.  We
    surface that as a {!Cascade_throttle.capacity_info} record with
    [source = Discovered], so the strategy treats it like a real
    capacity probe and prefers it over the client semaphore.

    The probe is deliberately {b synchronous} from the strategy's
    point of view: [cached_capacity] is a pure cache read.  The
    caller (typically the cascade entry in [oas_worker_named.ml])
    is responsible for invoking [try_probe] periodically — usually
    once per cascade attempt — to keep the cache warm.

    Cache TTL is short (a few seconds) because ollama state changes
    when other clients run inference.  Treating an old cache entry
    as authoritative is worse than missing the optimisation.

(** {1 Explicit URL registry}

    The {!Http_probe} adapter only fires against URLs that callers
    have explicitly registered.
    {!Masc_network_defaults.ollama_default_url} is registered at
    module load so the default deployment works without ceremony;
    other URLs (custom ports, remote tunnels) must be registered by
    a caller that already knows the URL is ollama-native. *)

val register_url : url:string -> unit

(** [is_registered ~url] reports whether [url] has been registered. *)
val is_registered : url:string -> bool

(** {1 Cache lookup (synchronous, IO-free)} *)

(** [cached_capacity ?now url] returns the most recent cache entry
    for [url] when its [recorded_at + ttl_ms / 1000 > now], or
    [None] when the cache is empty / expired / [url] was never
    probed.  The default [now] is [Unix.gettimeofday ()].

    Pure: never performs IO.  Safe to call from inside the
    strategy's pure [order_candidates] without breaking the
    strategy's "no IO" invariant — the IO already happened in
    the corresponding {!try_probe}. *)
val cached_capacity : ?now:float -> string -> Cascade_throttle.capacity_info option

(** {1 Active probe (performs HTTP GET)} *)

(** [try_probe ~sw ~net url] issues [GET <url>/api/ps] with a short
    timeout, parses the JSON body, and updates the cache.  Returns
    the freshly-recorded [capacity_info] on success; returns [None]
    (and does not touch the cache) on timeout, non-200, or parse
    failure.

    Default [timeout_s] is [0.5] seconds; pass an explicit
    [?timeout_s] argument to override per-call.

    Caller is responsible for picking registered ollama-native [url]s
    (use {!register_url} + {!is_registered} at the caller boundary);
    calling on a non-ollama URL will fail with a network error and
    return [None].

    The HTTP error path is intentionally silent — failed probes
    must never break the cascade, only deny the optimisation. *)

(** {1 Probing many URLs} *)

(** [refresh_many ~sw ~net urls] runs {!try_probe} on every registered URL in
    [urls] that is not already covered by a fresh cache entry.  Probes run sequentially in the
    caller's fiber; aggregate latency is bounded by [N * timeout_s]
    where [N] is the number of probes actually issued.

    Idempotent: URLs whose cache is still fresh are skipped. *)

(** {1 Pure JSON parser (test surface)} *)

(** [parse_response ?total json] interprets an ollama [/api/ps]
    response.  Returns [Some info] when [json] is a JSON object
    containing a [models] field that is a JSON array;
    [process_active] is set to the array length and
    [process_available] is [total - process_active] (clamped at
    zero).  [total] defaults to [1] (matches [OLLAMA_NUM_PARALLEL=1],
    the ollama default since 0.5).

    Returns [None] on any other shape — no field, wrong type,
    invalid JSON.  This makes the parser easy to unit-test without
    spinning up an HTTP server. *)
