(** Cascade trust JSONL snapshot.

    Periodically snapshots the global {!Cascade_health_tracker} state to
    [base_path/cascade_trust/YYYY-MM/DD.jsonl] for offline analysis of
    failure fingerprints, success-rate evolution, and provider availability.

    Pull model: a tick fiber polls {!Cascade_health_tracker.all_providers}
    every [snapshot_interval_s] (default 60s, env
    [MASC_CASCADE_TRUST_SNAPSHOT_SEC]) and appends one JSON object per
    tick.  Each object carries [ts] (Unix timestamp) and [providers]
    (list of structured provider rows mirroring {!provider_info}).

    Companion to Phase 0a observability (PR #10292) — fingerprint counter
    in {!Cascade_health_tracker} captures the *what*, this module
    captures the *over time*.  Hydration restores durable cooldown/failure
    state plus the latest bounded routing hints, so cascade selection does
    not restart with a cold latency/cost view after a process restart.

    Best-effort: I/O failures are logged but never propagated.
