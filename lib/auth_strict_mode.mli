(** Auth strictness flag (Phase A F2).

    Controls how [mcp_server_eio_execute] handles a bearer token that resolves
    to no credential.  The pre-Phase-A behavior was to silently keep the
    caller-supplied alias and emit a [silent:auth_token_resolve_error] warn —
    936 events/day in production (2026-04-26 measurement).

    Phase A F2 does not change behavior; it only adds a [would_reject]
    counter so operators can measure how many of those silent fallbacks
    represent legitimate vs illegitimate callers before Phase B PR-2 promotes
    [Strict] to a typed reject.

    Env flag values (canonical, case-insensitive):
    - [off]            : keep silent fallback, no [would_reject] emit
    - [dry_run]        : keep silent fallback, emit [would_reject] for soak
    - [strict]         : (Phase B PR-2) actually reject the request

    Default: [Dry_run].  The 48h soak collects [would_reject] cardinality so
    we can identify dashboard / internal callers that need their token wiring
    fixed before strict mode lands. *)

type t = Off | Dry_run | Strict

val of_string : string -> t
(** Pure parser for [MASC_AUTH_STRICT] values.  Case-insensitive,
    whitespace-trimmed.  Accepts [off|0|false], [strict|1|true],
    [dry_run|dry-run|""].  Unknown values fall through to [Dry_run] so
    operator omissions and typos do not silently disable measurement.

    Exposed so the pre-Phase-B contract (pinned variants, pinned default)
    is testable in isolation — the runtime [current ()] is not. *)

val current : unit -> t
(** Read [MASC_AUTH_STRICT] from the environment.  Unknown / missing values
    default to [Dry_run] so that operator omissions do not silently disable
    measurement. *)

val of_string : string -> t
(** Pure parser exposed for unit tests so Phase B PR-2's promotion of
    [Strict] to a typed reject lands on a parser whose canonical / alias
    / unknown handling has been pinned at the test boundary. Accepts
    ["off" | "0" | "false" | "dry_run" | "dry-run" | "strict" | "1" |
    "true"], case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed. Any other input
    returns [Dry_run] (fail-open for telemetry; fail-closed promotion
    to typed reject happens in Phase B). *)
val to_label : t -> string
(** [to_label Off = "off"], [Dry_run = "dry_run"], [Strict = "strict"].
    Used as the Prometheus [mode] label so operators can break down
    [masc_auth_strict_would_reject_total] by mode. *)
