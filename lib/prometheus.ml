(** {1 Global Metrics Store}

    [metrics] is updated from any fiber on any domain — LLM telemetry,
    keeper heartbeats, SSE bookkeeping, HTTP handlers. The previous
    implementation used a bare [Hashtbl.t] with [find_opt] + [add] which
    has two race windows:

    1. TOCTOU on registration: two fibers call [inc_counter] on a new
       key, both see [None], both [Hashtbl.add] — duplicate entries in
       the table.
    2. Non-atomic float update: [m.value <- m.value +. delta] reads,
       adds, writes without a memory barrier; two concurrent increments
       can both observe the same old value.

    We serialise every read and write path through [Stdlib.Mutex].
    Choice of primitive: operations must work during module
    initialisation ([let () = init ()] at EOF runs before any Eio
    scheduler exists), must hold across OCaml 5 domains (Executor_pool
    workers), and are individually cheap (a Hashtbl op + a float add) so
    the lock is never held long. [Stdlib.Mutex] fits all three. *)

let metrics : (string, metric) Hashtbl.t = Hashtbl.create 64
let metrics_mutex = Stdlib.Mutex.create ()

(* #10682 diagnostic: when EDEADLK fires (PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK
   detects same-thread re-entry on OCaml 5), lock raises Sys_error with
   message "Mutex.lock: Resource deadlock avoided". Without a backtrace,
   the actual re-entrant call site is invisible because [with_lock] is
   used by ~12 sites in this module and is reachable from every read
   tool dispatch. We capture the raw backtrace at the point of failure
   and stash it on a side-channel for the next render so the offending
   site self-documents. The non-failing path is unchanged. *)

(** {1 Metric Name Constants}

    Exported so registration here and [inc_counter] / [set_gauge]
    call-sites in the keeper modules share a single source of truth.
    Without this, a typo on either side produces a dead series with
    no build error (the counter silently drifts to a new key).

    Convention: constant name drops the Prometheus convention suffix
    ([_total] for counters), full metric name lives on the right-hand
    side. Consumers import [Prometheus.<constant>] so the compiler
    catches typos. *)

   Operators use this counter to detect drift: the same
   ([model_used], [resolved_model_id]) pair should land in ONE
   bucket; observing two buckets means the resolution path
   produced different ceilings on different turns.  The 42% /

   timeout budget.  Labels are bounded by fleet size, configured model
   labels, configured cascades, channel vocabulary, and the five bucket

(* #10125: keeper supervisor sweep observability.

   The supervisor sweep is a Pulse loop that recovers crashed

   silently dies — keepers exit on cascade exhaustion and nobody
   restarts them.  Observed 2026-04-24: 14 keepers dead, supervisor
   "started" log line missing for 4h+ across a server restart.

   Two metrics surface the sweep liveness directly so dashboards
   can alert on absence instead of relying on a log grep:

   - [metric_keeper_supervisor_sweep_starts_total] — increments
     once each time [start_supervisor_sweep] actually creates a
     Pulse (i.e., once per process unless explicitly stopped).
     If the counter does not advance after a server restart, the
     supervisor never came up.
   - [metric_keeper_supervisor_last_sweep_unixtime] — gauge updated
     on every successful sweep beat.  Operator alert:
     [time() - masc_keeper_supervisor_last_sweep_unixtime > 90]
     means the sweep is stalled (default sweep interval is 30s). *)

   the slot for a long-running OAS call (276s-963s observed) ran
   past the 60s wait budget, every waiting keeper timed out, and

   and operators cannot tell from logs *why* — many fallback branches in the
   keeper request path use [| Error _ -> default] / [| None -> fallback]
   without any structured log emit. The unknown-silence symptom.

   These counters surface the live rate of each silent fallback so the
   dashboard can distinguish "code path is dead" from "code path fires
   constantly and silently corrupts identity / risk classification". Each
   silent point gets a distinct counter with [agent] / [reason] labels so
   we can attribute the silence back to a specific keeper.

   Pair these counters with [Log.<area>.warn] emits at the same call sites
   so grep-based debugging works in addition to dashboard alerts. *)
