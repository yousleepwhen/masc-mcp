(* #10097: a provider cannot carry keeper-bound runtime MCP tools that
   need request-scoped auth headers.  Every time
   oas_worker_exec_transport strips such a tool, this counter
   increments with the [provider] and [tool] labels so dashboards can
   track WHICH provider strips WHICH tools and at WHAT rate.  Paired
   with a once-per-session WARN log ([fingerprint]-deduplicated) so
   the operator sees the structural fact exactly once while the
   counter carries the frequency signal.

   RFC-0058 §2.4 / Phase 5.4 big-bang rename: the old
   the legacy `masc_<provider>_mcp_tool_omission_total` time series is RETIRED.
   Operators must point Grafana queries to the new
   `masc_provider_mcp_tool_omission_total{provider="<provider_slug>"}`
   series.  No dual-emit alias — the rename is intentional to keep
   provider identity out of the metric name. *)

   producers. *)

   in [lib/coord.ml] [observe_agent_lifecycle] / [observe_task_transition_event] /
   [Keeper_accountability.record_task_transition].  Those three try/with
   sites swallow the exception that fires when the lifecycle hook is
   dispatched from a non-Eio context (test path, bootstrap, certain HTTP
   handlers).  Before this counter, the entire Audit_log + Telemetry pair
   silently disappeared, exactly matching the 5-tag → 2-tag attrition
   ledger pattern (only [tool_called] survives because it is wired on a
   different fiber-bearing path).  Labels: [event_family] (one of
   [agent_lifecycle] / [task_transition] / [accountability]) and
   [event_kind] (the lifecycle/transition variant). [event_kind] for
   [agent_lifecycle] is one of [join] / [rejoin] / [leave] (3 values).
   [event_kind] for both [task_transition] and [accountability] uses the
   8 [Masc_domain.task_action_to_string] values: [claim] / [start] /
   [done] / [cancel] / [release] / [submit_for_verification] / [approve]
   / [reject]. Both vocabularies are bounded so series cardinality is at
   most 19 (3 + 8 + 8). *)

(* #10094: per-caller counter for [Masc_oas_bridge.run_safe]
   timeouts.  The [caller] string supplied at the run_safe entry
   point lets the operator see WHICH caller is timing out at
   WHICH configured budget without grepping warn-level log
   lines.  Paired with per-caller env-overridable defaults in
   [Env_config_oas_bridge] so 60s "fantasy" budgets in
   [auto_responder] / [dashboard_provider_runs] no longer
   silently masquerade as the same class of event as
   intentional 120s/180s budgets in persona authoring / deep_review. *)

(* Increments each time [Keeper_turn_slot.force_release_holder_for] frees
   a slot held by a zombie fiber (typically because the fiber is stuck
   inside an LLM subprocess that did not honour cancellation). Without
   this path the slot stays held until process restart, starving the
   fleet behind the [reactive_turn_semaphore]. Labels: keeper, label
   ([turn] / [autonomous] / [reactive]). A positive rate means the
   force-release path is the only thing draining stuck slots, which is
   itself a signal that the upstream subprocess kill-on-cancel is
   incomplete and worth investigating. *)
(* P0-2 (2026-05-07): observability for orphan turn loops.
   [_dropped] increments every time [Keeper_registry.update_entry] is
   called against a missing key (caller raced with deregistration).
   [_orphan_threshold_breached] increments once per breach event when
   the per-keeper drop count crosses [orphan_drop_threshold] inside
   [orphan_drop_window_sec]. Together they let operators tell a
   harmless single-update race from a stuck orphan fiber emitting 30+
   drops per turn. See masc-mcp 2026-05-07 verifier-loop incident. *)
(* Self-healing circuit breaker: incremented each time [sweep_and_recover]
   auto-resumes a keeper after its back-off timer has elapsed.  A rate >0
   means the system is self-healing; a zero rate while keepers accumulate
   [auto_resume_after_sec] means the sweep is not firing or the meta write
   is failing. Labels: keeper. *)
(* Phase-3.5 health-gate block: incremented when the supervisor skips
   auto-resume because the keeper's cascade is unhealthy (failure ratio
   >= threshold).  Labels: keeper, cascade.  A positive rate means the
   health probe is actively protecting the fleet from resuming into a
   still-failing cascade. *)
(* Positive signal for the Skip_idle + Woken gate-promotion path added
   by #12271. Increments every time run_smart_heartbeat_gate observes
   that an external wakeup_keeper call cut a Skip_idle backoff sleep
   short and the cycle was resumed (KeeperHeartbeat.tla HeartbeatTick
   action). A zero rate after operator-visible board signals to a Live
   keeper means the fix path is not firing — either the wakeup never
   reached the atomic, or a regression silently re-introduced
   MissedWakeup. Pair with stale_termination_by_class for full
   positive/negative coverage. Labels: keeper. *)
(* #12801: Liveness Recovery Supervisor — auto-recover Dead keepers
   whose root cause has cleared.  [attempts] increments each time the
   scan selects a Dead keeper for recovery; [outcomes] breaks out the
   result by outcome label (started | not_running | meta_missing |
   meta_read_failed | meta_write_failed). Labels: keeper (for
   attempts) and keeper+outcome (for outcomes). *)
(* #12799: Passive loop detector — keeper emitting only read-only tool
   calls for N consecutive turns.  Labels: keeper. *)

(* Task-138: Minimum proactive cadence — observability gauges that pair
   with the [keeper_passive_loop_detector] streak counter so operators
   can see "alive but unproductive" keepers in Grafana before the
   detection latch fires.  Labels: keeper. *)
(* PR-M (Leak 9): consecutive [provider_timeout] cycle FAILED strikes
   per keeper. Counter increments on each strike. At the limit, the
   heartbeat loop records [outcome=soft_backoff] unless
   [Keeper_failure_policy] sees separate keeper-liveness loss and returns
   a death-allowed decision. *)

(* Catch-all entries in [Cascade_event_bridge.native_event_to_json]
   for OAS payload variants that have not yet received an explicit
   arm in this consumer.  A non-zero rate per [kind] label means an
   upstream OAS pin bump shipped a new payload variant before the
   masc-mcp consumer was migrated; SSE subscribers receive only a
   kind-only placeholder payload until the explicit arm is added. *)

(* [Cascade_attempt_fsm.provider_label] receives an empty/blank string
