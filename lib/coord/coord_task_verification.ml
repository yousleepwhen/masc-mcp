(** Verification-evidence helpers for coord task lifecycle,
    extracted from coord_task.ml.

    Phase D (RFC-0109 #18715) routed contracted submissions through the
    typed [Cdal_evidence_gate] decision. Phase E (this module rewrite)
    retires the legacy substring-classifier predicates that used to
    reject empty/analysis-only submissions at the transition layer.

    Evidence refs are now collected by typed concat from contract
    metadata, handoff context, and a non-empty/non-placeholder notes
    string. They are forwarded to [Verification_protocol.create_submit_request]
    as observability metadata only — the gating decision lives in
    [Cdal_evidence_gate]. *)
