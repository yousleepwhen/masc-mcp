(** Mention parsing module - Stateless/Stateful/Broadcast routing modes

(* Target-keyed cache for [is_mentioned]'s compiled regex.

   The pattern interpolates [target] (an agent name) so it cannot
   be compiled at module load like the static parse patterns above.
   But the set of distinct targets is bounded by the agent fleet
   (~20 in production), so a Hashtbl keyed by trimmed target is
   enough — no LRU needed, the cache stabilises after warm-up.

   Without this cache, [any_mentioned ~targets content] for N
   targets re-ran [Re.compile] N times per call.  Per-keeper
   message-policy evaluation (keeper_memory_policy /
   keeper_context_runtime / keeper_prompt) re-paid that on every
   message, so with 14 keepers × per-message direct-mention checks
   the compile cost was a sustained tax.

   [Stdlib.Mutex] (not [Eio.Mutex]) because callers may run from
   non-Eio contexts and the hold time is bounded by a
   [Hashtbl.find_opt] + occasional one-shot compile per new target. *)
