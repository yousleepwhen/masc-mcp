(** Coord Hooks — Callback refs for upper-layer dependencies.

    Coord modules must not depend on Activity_graph, Board,
    Agent_economy, Relation_materializer, or Oas_worker directly.
    Instead, they call these callback refs which are wired at startup
    by room.ml (the hub module that already depends on everything).

    Defaults are no-ops or error stubs. *)

(** #9645: distributed lock acquire failure observability.

    [Coord_utils_ops.with_distributed_lock] / [..._r] raise

    retry budget when keeper fleet contention prevents acquiring
    a lock (production observed [tasks:.backlog] starvation under
    16-keeper load).  The error path is the only signal — there
    is no fleet-wide rate metric for "how often does this fail,
    on which key?".

    This hook decouples the emit from [masc_mcp.Prometheus] (which
    sits above [masc_coord] in the dep graph).  [lib/coord.ml]
    wires it to a Prometheus counter at startup; [masc_coord]
    callers fire it from the failure branches without taking a

(** #10449: Task completion path observability.

    Issue #10449 documented that 16 task done transitions over 3
    days saw only 1 (6.25%) traverse the [awaiting_verification]
    gate. The [verifier-gate redirect] in [Tool_task] only fires
    when [task.contract] has a non-empty [completion_contract] or
    [required_evidence] list, so tasks created without contracts
    bypass verification entirely.

    The pre-existing [fsm_drift_observer_fn] only counts the
    [Claimed → Done] skip pattern (skipping [in_progress]); it
    does not split by contract presence, so operators cannot tell
    whether the bypass rate comes from missing contracts
    (creation-side problem) or from the redirect mis-firing
    (gate-side problem).

    This hook fires once per successful transition into [Done] and
    classifies the path along two axes:

    - [path]: ["claimed_to_done_skip"] / ["in_progress_to_done"] /
      ["via_verification"] / ["forced_done"]
    - [contract_state]: ["no_contract"] / ["empty_contract"] /
      ["with_contract"]

    Cardinality is bounded at ~4 × 3 × fleet_size series, safe
    for Prometheus.  Emit lives in [lib/coord.ml] to avoid a
    [masc_coord → Prometheus] dep cycle. *)

(** #10421: task_claim_next implicit auto-release observability.

    When a keeper calls [task_claim_next] while still holding a
    previous claim, the scheduler implicitly transitions that prior
    claim back to [Todo] before issuing the new one.  Field log
    showed 43 [claimed → todo] transitions vs 24 [todo → claimed]
    in a single day (179% release/claim ratio), with only 1/71
    transitions reaching [done] — the same task hot-potatoed up to
    5x as keepers churned through claim_next without finishing.

    The structured event already carries [reason] and
    [from_status], but a Prometheus counter is the missing surface:
    operators cannot alert on auto-release rate or split it by
    keeper from a JSONL tail alone.  The split by [from_status]
    matters because [Claimed → Todo] (just claimed, no work yet)
    and [InProgress → Todo] (mid-work, lost progress) are
    operationally distinct symptoms.

    Cardinality bounded by fleet size (~10 keepers) ×
    [from_status] (claimed | in_progress) = ~20 series.  Emit at
    [lib/coord.ml] to avoid a [masc_coord → Prometheus] dep cycle. *)

(** task-103: Auto-provision a sandbox worktree on successful task claim.

    [Coord_task.claim_task_r] flips a task to [Claimed] but does not create
    the per-task git worktree the keeper subprocess will need (the LLM is
    expected to create repo-local worktrees explicitly, but in practice
    keepers often skip that step and immediately try to [cd] into the
    worktree path inside docker, which fails with [fatal: not a git
    repository: .../keeper-<agent>-<task>]).

    This hook is called best-effort right after a successful claim. The
    consumer (lib/keeper) decides whether to actually provision based on
    keeper [sandbox_profile] (only [Docker] keepers benefit; local-host
    keepers operate on the project root directly). Failures are logged but
    do not block the claim — claim semantics stay independent of sandbox
    state.

    Wired in [lib/keeper/keeper_runtime.ml] at startup; the default no-op
    keeps [masc_coord] free of a direct dependency on [masc_mcp]. *)
