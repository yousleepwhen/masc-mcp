(** Activity_graph_registry — SSE client registry guarded by an
    [Eio.Mutex].

    {!Activity_graph} re-exports the public surface via
    [include Activity_graph_registry] so it can iterate
    {!clients} and {!client_matches} from inside its event
    fan-out without re-introducing the cycle this split was
    extracted to break.

    Internal storage (the [registry_mutex] handle and the
    [client_id_counter] monotonic id source) is hidden — callers
    consume only the locked accessors and the lifecycle entry
    points. *)

(** A registered SSE client. The record is exposed concretely
    because {!Activity_graph} reads / mutates [last_seq] from
    inside the fan-out and reads [kind_filters] via
    {!client_matches}; hiding the layout would force getter
    pairs without making the abstraction any richer. *)

val clients : (string, client) Hashtbl.t
(** Live session-id → client table. {!Activity_graph} iterates
    this Hashtbl from its broadcast loop under
    {!with_registry_ro}; mutations must go through {!register} /
    {!unregister} / {!unregister_if_current}. *)

val with_registry_rw :

(** Run [f ()] under a read-write lock on {!clients}. When the
    Eio runtime is not yet ready ([Eio_guard.is_ready () = false],
    e.g. during boot), [f ()] runs unlocked — the registry has
    no readers / writers at that point.

    the freshly-allocated [client_id] (monotonic, never reused). *)

val unregister : string -> unit

    no client is registered. *)

val unregister_if_current : string -> int -> unit
(** Drop the client for [session_id] iff its current
    [client_id] equals the given one. Used to avoid a TOCTOU
    where a slow disconnect handler removes a client another
    fiber has already replaced via {!register}. *)
