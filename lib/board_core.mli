(** Board_core — in-memory board store, persistence, and
    canonical post / comment operations.

    The .ml is a 687-line module that splits into four
    layers:

    - {b Type / classification} re-exported via
      [include Board_core_classify] (which itself does
      [include Board_types]) — every {!Board_types} surface
      entry, every visibility / post-kind variant, and the
      [reclassify_report] record reach callers via this
      facade.
    - {b Payload normalisation} re-exported via
      [include Board_core_payload] — state-block extraction,
      post-title derivation, and the canonical
      [normalize_post_payload].
    - {b Local store + persistence} (this .mli's locally
      pinned surface) — sweeper / lock / cache /
      JSONL-rotate / append helpers.
    - {b Public board operations} — create / get / list /
      search / reclassify post + comment APIs.

    Cascade-include preserves type identity end-to-end with
    [include module type of struct include M end] (cycle
    187 rationale).  {!Board_votes} does its own
    [include Board_core], which transitively reaches the
    top-level {!Board} facade — every helper consumed by
    that chain (the 13 unqualified usages from
    [board_votes.ml] plus the 15 [Board.X] dotted callers
    that resolve into Board_core defs) is pinned below.

    Internal helpers stay private at this boundary
    ([persist_errors] atomic counter, [record_persist_error],
    [remove_from_list_index], [maybe_sweep],
    [board_masc_dir], [ensure_dir], [max_jsonl_bytes],
    [append_post], [append_comment]). *)

(** {1 Persist-error counter} *)

(** Returns the cumulative count of persist failures since
    process start.  The counter is bumped by the internal
    [record_persist_error] path whenever a [Sys_error] is
    swallowed during JSONL append / rotate; consumed by the
    operator dashboard for at-a-glance health. *)
val persist_error_count : unit -> int

(** Record and log a board persistence failure. *)
val record_persist_error : where:string -> string -> unit

(** {1 Configuration} *)

(** Re-export of [Env_config.Board.flush_interval_sec].  How
    often the board flusher actor consumes a [Flush] message
    from {!store.flusher_inbox}. *)
val flush_interval_sec : float

(** {1 Store lifecycle} *)

(** Builds a fresh empty store with default Hashtbl capacities
    (1024 posts / 4096 comments / 2048 vote-log entries),
    fresh [Eio.Mutex], cold caches, and an [Eio.Stream]
    [flusher_inbox] capped at 1000 messages. *)
val create_store : unit -> store

(** Reset the per-author comment rate-limit tracker.  Test-only. *)
val reset_comment_rate_tracker : unit -> unit

(** Check whether [author] is currently rate-limited at time [now].
    Returns [Some retry_after] if the author has reached the limit,
    [None] otherwise. *)
val check_comment_rate_limit : author:string -> now:float -> float option

(** Record a comment timestamp for [author] at time [now].
    Used internally by [add_comment_with_status]; exposed for test
    manipulation of the sliding window. *)
val record_comment_timestamp : author:string -> now:float -> unit

(** {1 Locking + cache invalidation} *)

(** [with_lock store f] runs [f ()] under
    [Eio.Mutex.use_rw ~protect:true store.mutex].  Callers
    should keep the critical section short and avoid I/O —
    {!create_post} for instance does its [Agent_economy.earn]
    {b outside} the lock so the ledger write does not block
    every other reader / writer. *)
val with_lock : store -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** [with_persist_lock store f] serializes JSONL writes that must run
    after the state mutation lock has been released. *)
val with_persist_lock : store -> (unit -> 'a) -> 'a

(** Clears [karma_cache] and [sorted_posts_cache].  Called
    after every post mutation. *)
val invalidate_post_caches : store -> unit

(** Clears [karma_cache].  Called after every comment
    mutation (comments contribute to the karma rollup but
    not to the sorted-posts cache). *)
val invalidate_comment_caches : store -> unit

(** {1 Sweeper} *)

(** Drops expired posts / comments from the in-memory store
    in batches up to {!Limits.sweeper_batch_size}.  Permanent
    posts ([expires_at = 0.0]) are skipped.  Returns
    [(removed_posts, removed_comments)]. *)
val sweep : store -> int * int

(** {1 Persistence paths + rotation} *)

(** Resolves the board base path from {!Env_config}.  Used by
    {!persist_path}, {!comments_path}, and the
    [Agent_economy.earn] integration in {!create_post}. *)
val board_base_path : unit -> string

(** Path to the board posts JSONL log under
    [<base>/.masc/board-posts.jsonl]. *)
val persist_path : unit -> string

(** Path to the board comments JSONL log under
    [<base>/.masc/board-comments.jsonl]. *)
val comments_path : unit -> string

(** Path to the board reactions JSONL snapshot under
    [<base>/.masc/board_reactions.jsonl]. *)
val reactions_path : unit -> string

(** Idempotent [.masc] directory creation; called before
    every JSONL append. *)
val ensure_masc_dir : unit -> unit

(** Rotates the JSONL file at [path] when it exceeds
    [max_jsonl_bytes] (10 MiB).  The previous file is
    renamed with a timestamp suffix; rotation failures are
    routed through the persist-error counter so the runtime
    keeps appending to the live file rather than aborting. *)
val rotate_if_needed : string -> unit

(** {1 Append-only persistence} *)

(** Appends one post snapshot to {!persist_path}. *)
val append_post : post -> unit

(** Appends one comment snapshot to {!comments_path}. *)
val append_comment : comment -> unit

(** {1 Whole-state JSONL rewrite} *)

(** Atomically rewrites {!persist_path} from
    [store.posts].  The implementation snapshots under [store.mutex]
    and performs disk I/O under the persist lock after releasing the
    state lock; callers must not invoke it while already holding
    [store.mutex]. *)
val rewrite_posts : store -> unit

(** Atomically rewrites {!comments_path} from
    [store.comments].  Same usage pattern as
    {!rewrite_posts}. *)
val rewrite_comments : store -> unit

(** Atomically rewrites {!reactions_path} from [store.reactions]. *)
val rewrite_reactions : store -> unit

(** Rewrites reactions assuming the caller already owns [store.mutex]. *)
val rewrite_reactions_unlocked : store -> unit

(** Marks one post for append-only deferred persistence.  Call with
    [store.mutex] already held. *)
val mark_dirty_post : store -> string -> unit

(** Marks one comment for append-only deferred persistence.  Call with
    [store.mutex] already held. *)
val mark_dirty_comment : store -> string -> unit

(** {1 Post operations} *)

(** Result of a create-post attempt before the legacy API folds it
    back to just the persisted/found post.  Dispatch layers use this
    to avoid re-emitting post-created fanout for receive-side dedup
    hits. *)
type create_post_outcome =
  | Fresh_post of post
  | Dedup_hit of post
  | Rolled_up_post of post

(** Extract the post carried by {!create_post_outcome}. *)
val post_of_create_post_outcome : create_post_outcome -> post

(** Creates a post and preserves whether the operation was fresh, a receive-side
    dedup hit, or a status-only automation rollup.  Same validation and
    persistence semantics as {!create_post}; fresh posts append JSONL + earn
    credits, while dedup/rollup hits return the existing post without those
    create-side effects. *)

  -> ?visibility:visibility
  -> ?ttl_hours:int
  -> ?hearth:string
  -> ?thread_id:string
  -> unit
  -> (create_post_outcome, board_error) Result.t

(** Creates a new post.  Validates [author] via
    {!Agent_id.of_string}, normalises [hearth] (lowercased +
    trimmed), folds the canonical [title / body / kind /
    meta] via {!normalize_post_payload}, then writes under
    {!with_lock}.  [ttl_hours = 0] persists indefinitely
    (clamped to 0 for human posts; automation / system
    posts are forced to {!Limits.automation_ttl_hours}).
    Errors on validation failure, capacity exhaustion
    ([Capacity_exceeded]), or content length overflow.  The
    JSONL append and the [Agent_economy.earn] credit are intentionally
    performed {b outside} the state lock to avoid blocking concurrent
    readers on filesystem writes. *)

  -> (post, board_error) Result.t

val get_post : store -> post_id:string -> (post, board_error) Result.t

(** Coalesces [get_post] + [get_comments] under a single
    {!with_lock} block to avoid the two-call lock churn
    that previously surfaced as
    [Mutex.lock: Resource deadlock avoided] under contended
    keeper polling. *)
val get_post_and_comments
  :  store
  -> post_id:string
  -> (post * comment list, board_error) Result.t

(** Re-runs {!legacy_migrate_post_kind} against persisted
    posts to detect classification drift.  [limit]
    (default 5200) is clamped to [0..5200].  [dry_run]
    (default [true]) reports drift without mutating the
    store; setting it to [false] applies the new kind +
    rewrites the JSONL.  The returned
    {!reclassify_report.changed_post_ids} list caps at 20
    entries for log-friendly summarisation. *)
val reclassify_posts : store -> ?limit:int -> ?dry_run:bool -> unit -> reclassify_report

(** Returns posts sorted by [(score desc, created_at desc)]
    with optional visibility / hearth filters and a hard
    cap of {!Limits.max_posts} (10000) regardless of the
    requested [limit].  Uses [store.sorted_posts_cache] when
    warm to skip the sort. *)
val list_posts

    only on the result size).  Returns matches sorted by
    [created_at desc]. *)
val search_posts : store -> predicate:(post -> bool) -> limit:int -> post list

(** {1 Comment operations} *)

(** Validates [post_id] / [author] / optional [parent_id]
    via {!Post_id.of_string} / {!Agent_id.of_string} /
    {!Comment_id.of_string} before taking the lock.
    Exact duplicate [(post_id, parent_id, author, content)] writes
    return the existing comment without appending JSONL, incrementing
    [reply_count], or consuming thread capacity.
    Capacity guarded against {!Limits.max_comments_per_post}
    and the global [Limits.max_comments] ceiling.  Awards
    [Agent_economy.earn] credits outside the lock (same
    rationale as {!create_post}). *)

(** Returns up to [limit] (default 1000) most recent

    rewrites {!sub_boards_path} under the persist lock. *)
val rewrite_sub_boards : store -> unit

(** Creates a new sub-board with the given slug (unique, lowercase).
    [members] are canonicalised agent ids; the owner is always included.
    Returns [Validation_error] when the slug is invalid or already taken,
    [Capacity_exceeded] when the sub-board limit is reached. JSONL append
    persistence is performed outside the state lock. *)
