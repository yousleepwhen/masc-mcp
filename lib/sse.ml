(** SSE (Server-Sent Events) module for MCP Streamable HTTP Transport
    MCP Spec 2025-03-26 compliant

    Concurrency model (per-session stream):
    Each registered client owns an [Eio.Stream.t] mailbox.
    [broadcast] and [send_to] push formatted SSE strings into per-client
    streams under a read-only registry snapshot -- no global write-lock
    during fan-out.  Each SSE connection fiber drains its own stream via
    [pop], calling the transport-layer write independently.

    Session registries use immutable maps behind [Atomic.t] CAS loops.
    Broadcast fan-out runs over a snapshot and never holds a global lock
    while enqueueing per-client events.

    Session kinds:
    [Observer] sessions receive dashboard snapshots but not agent
    coordination traffic.  [Coordinator] sessions receive heartbeats
    and task events but not dashboard snapshots.  [Presence] sessions
    receive ephemeral liveness/awareness updates through the bufferless
    presence channel.  [broadcast_to All] reaches every durable session
    (backward-compatible with the old [broadcast]).

    Signal handler safety: registry operations avoid [Eio.Mutex] and rely on
    immutable snapshots plus CAS, so readers can inspect counts without
    waiting on a lock held by another fiber. *)

    Cap exists because broadcast fan-out at 64+ keepers + multiple
    dashboard tabs accumulates faster than slow consumers can drain;
    the default is sized so silent eviction does not coincide with the

(** Format SSE event with optional ID and event type.

    When [~id] is supplied the caller has already allocated the event
    ID (typically via {!next_id}); this function must NOT touch the
    counter, or the caller's allocation + this call's
    [fetch_and_add] would leave [event_counter] 2× the number of
    emitted events.  That drift also widens the window for the
    broadcast_impl / send_to peek-then-format pattern: two fibers
    that both peek the counter, both get the same value, and then
    both pass it as [~id] would emit events with the **same** id,
    breaking MCP SSE resumability (the [last_event_id] filter in
    [get_events_after] skips by id, so a duplicate would be
    dropped).

    When [~id] is omitted (external callers in
    [server_mcp_transport_http] / [server_mcp_transport_http_agui])
    this function still allocates a fresh id atomically, preserving
    their contract. *)

     plus the [%d]/[%s] dispatch overhead before the result string was
     produced.  A single [Buffer] accumulator with primitive
     [string_of_int] sidesteps the format interpreter entirely and
     emits exactly the bytes the SSE wire format requires (id-line +
     optional event-line + data-line + blank).  The output string is

(** Per-session disconnect hook registry.

    A disconnect hook fires when [unregister] / [unregister_if_current]
    removes a session from [clients].  Its purpose is to wake the
    transport-layer drain fiber that is otherwise blocked on
    [Eio.Stream.take]: removing the session from the broadcast registry
    stops new events from arriving, but the drain fiber holds the HTTP
    connection's [info.stop] flag and must be signalled separately.

    Without this hook, queue-overflow [unregister] calls (broadcast skip
    fixup at [broadcast_impl]) leak HTTP connections with stale drain
    fibers — manifesting as "WS events stop arriving but the browser
    still shows connected" until keep-alive timeout reaps the socket
    minutes later.  This was the silent half of the
    [Transport_metrics.inc_broadcast_failure] path.

    The hook is invoked exactly once: it is removed from the registry
    inside the same atomic update that observes its presence, so even
    racing [unregister] / [unregister_if_current] calls cannot double-fire.
    Hook callbacks are wrapped in try/with — exceptions are logged and
    swallowed (except [Eio.Cancel.Cancelled]) so a misbehaving callback
    cannot strand the broadcast fan-out. *)
