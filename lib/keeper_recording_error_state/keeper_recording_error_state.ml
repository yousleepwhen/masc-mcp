(* WORKAROUND-CARRYOVER: tracked by docs/rfc/RFC-0144-workaround-sunset-keeper-dedup-carryover.md.
   Removal: per-[error_kind] sunset criteria (§4). This layer demotes repeated
   ERROR lines to DEBUG; the root fix is reducing the underlying error rate
   (per-arm root-fix table in RFC §3). *)

(* Dedupe state for [Keeper_registry.record_error] noise.

   See [.mli] for the rationale. This module is intentionally stdlib-only
   (Digest + [Bounded_event_dedupe]) so it can be linked into both the
   main library and standalone unit tests without dragging Eio in.

   Threading: [Bounded_event_dedupe] guards the in-memory table with a
   [Mutex.t]. Public entry points perform only key creation and integer
   state updates, so contention is bounded.

   Memory: there is no eviction policy. The MASC server lifetime is in
   the hour-to-day range; the number of distinct [(keeper, error)]
   fingerprints over that window is empirically <1k from production
   logs (cf. system_log_2026-05-16.jsonl analysis), so unbounded
   accumulation is acceptable for this iteration. If a runaway-error
   producer is identified later, an LRU layer is the right
   addition — not a probabilistic filter. *)
