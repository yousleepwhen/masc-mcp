(** Keeper transient-retry backoff configuration.

    Exponential backoff knobs for the keeper outer-loop transient
    retry path plus the productive slot-phase budget gate used by
    [Keeper_turn_cascade_budget] when deciding whether a degraded
    retry rotation may proceed.

    Verbatim extract from [Env_config_keeper.KeeperRetryBackoff];
    the parent now does
    [module KeeperRetryBackoff = Env_config_keeper_retry_backoff]
    and existing call sites resolve through the parent module alias
    unchanged. *)

(** Productive slot-phase budget (seconds).  PR #13120: when a
    cascade returns a recoverable error after the keeper has
    already burned this many seconds inside the outer turn slot,
    degraded retry rotation is rejected (the rotation evidence is
    still recorded in [cascade_rotation_attempts] for audit).  The
    keeper releases the outer slot instead of holding it for a
    retry that may itself stall.  OAS timeout-budget failures may
    still rotate to the next degraded cascade when retry budget remains,
    because the first attempt already consumed its bounded provider
    budget.  Floor 5s prevents accidental always-reject configs.

    Declared here (not in keeper_turn_cascade_budget.ml) so the
    env knob catalog generator at bin/env_knob_catalog.ml picks
    it up — the catalog only scans lib/config/env_config_*.ml.

    Calibrated to the attempt-liveness bootstrap floor so that
    slow-but-honest streams are not denied a degraded retry solely
    because their first-token latency exceeds the old 60 s floor.
    Providers with successful history can learn a wider candidate
    budget without hard-coding provider or model-size classes. *)
