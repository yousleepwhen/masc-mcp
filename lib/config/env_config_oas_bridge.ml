(** Env_config_oas_bridge — per-caller OAS bridge timeout SSOT (#10094).

    Replaces seven hardcoded [Masc_oas_bridge.run_safe ~timeout_s:N.N]
    literals scattered across the lib tree.  Each caller is named so:

      1. its default is preserved when the original literal was a
         deliberately-tuned value (tool_deep_review=180s,
         anti_rationalization=180s);
      2. the two old "fantasy" 60s budgets ([auto_responder],
         [dashboard_provider_runs]) get raised to [default_timeout_sec]
         (300s) — the original 60s did not match observed p50 latency
         (50–700s) and produced 27 timeouts/session;
      3. dashboard judge daemons stay advisory and bounded by default
         instead of holding an OAS CLI subprocess for multiple dashboard
         refresh intervals;
      4. the operator can override any single caller's budget via
         [MASC_OAS_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_<CALLER>_SEC];
      5. the operator can set a fallback for unknown / future callers
         via [MASC_OAS_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_SEC].

    The lookup order is per-caller env > per-caller hardcoded default
    > [MASC_OAS_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_SEC] > 300.0.  An unknown
    caller (future caller without a typed default) falls through to
    the global default rather than failing closed — the operator will
    see [metric_oas_bridge_timeout{caller=...}] in Prometheus
    regardless. *)

(** Hardcoded default seconds for each known caller.  When the
    original literal was 60s on a path with observed p50 above 60s,
    we raise to [global_default_sec] (300s) — silent fix for the
    fantasy budgets called out in #10094.  When the original literal
    was 120/180s on a path that intentionally needed more compute,
    we preserve the value so the fix does not regress
    deep_review / anti_rationalization. *)
let global_default_sec = 300.0

(** Dashboard judges are background/advisory signal generators.  They run on the
    operator screen cadence, so a default at or above the generic 300s worker
    budget can pin a CLI-backed OAS child for several refreshes and starve the
    live dashboard.  Keep this below the default 60s judge interval; operators
    can still raise it per caller when they explicitly prefer completeness over
    responsiveness. *)

(** [timeout_sec ~caller ()] resolves the OAS bridge timeout for
    [caller].  Lookup order:

      1. Per-caller env [MASC_OAS_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_<CALLER>_SEC]
         — wins unconditionally.  Lets the operator tune one
         caller without touching others.
      2. Per-caller checked-in default ([known_default_sec]).
         Preserves intentional 120/180s budgets for compute-heavy
         callers; raises the old fantasy 60s worker budgets to
         [global_default_sec] (300s); bounds dashboard judge daemons to
         [dashboard_judge_default_sec].
      3. Global env [MASC_OAS_BRIDGE_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT_SEC] — only
         consulted for UNKNOWN callers (typo, future caller
         without a default entry).  Treating it as an override
         would let one slow provider silently shift every
         caller's budget; that is a footgun.
      4. [global_default_sec] (300s) hardcoded final fallback. *)
