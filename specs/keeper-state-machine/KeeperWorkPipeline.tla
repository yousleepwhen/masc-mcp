---- MODULE KeeperWorkPipeline ----
\* ── STATUS: ASPIRATIONAL DESIGN INVARIANT (not wired to current runtime) ──
\* This spec describes a future workspace/PR/commit pipeline. Re-verified
\* 2026-05-12 (iter 88 — banner anti-staleness check):
\*   - The legacy autonomous GitHub exec runtime this spec once named is
\*     still absent.  NOTE: the 2026-04-20 probe `find lib -name
\*     "*github*"` is no longer the right signal — GitHub credentials and
\*     metrics helpers can exist without implying an autonomous
\*     work-pipeline runtime.  The durable signal is the primitive set
\*     below.
\*   - The primitives this spec models — `force_push_attempted`,
\*     `workspace_init`, `workspace_cleaned`, `commit_identity`,
\*     `submit_count` — STILL have 0 hits in lib/keeper/ (this is the
\*     anti-staleness probe to use: `rg 'force_push_attempted|workspace_init'
\*     lib/keeper/` → 0).
\*   - Runner status (was "NOT in scripts/tla-check.sh"): this spec IS in
\*     the corpus (specs/Makefile, scripts/ci/check-tla-harness-coverage.sh)
\*     and has a bug-model partner (specs/bug-models/KeeperWorkPipelineBug.tla),
\*     but it is listed in specs/Makefile's KNOWN_FAILURES — "clean spec
\*     violates invariant (exit 13) — model needs fix, not path issue" — so
\*     `make -C specs check-clean` skipped it until 2026-05-25.  The clean
\*     model now verifies after adding weak fairness to the intra-pipeline
\*     progress actions below; the runtime-not-wired situation is still
\*     separate and should remain visible in this banner.
\* The actual keeper tool runtime surface is descriptor-routed agent_tool_*_runtime
\* modules with a different state shape.
\* See issue #9044 for the retire / re-target / banner trichotomy.
\* This banner takes the "banner" option to make the aspirational nature
\* explicit; treat the safety properties below as forward-looking design
\* documentation, not runtime invariants — and note that one of them is
\* currently violated by the model itself (KNOWN_FAILURES, above).

\*
\* Keeper Autonomous Work Pipeline — TLA+ Formal Specification (DESIGN)
\*
\* Models the deterministic core of a keeper's autonomous task execution:
\* workspace lifecycle, file operations, commit safety, PR creation, review cycles.
\*
\* Complementary to KeeperStateMachine (lifecycle) and KeeperTurnCycle (turns).
\* This spec models what happens WITHIN a Running phase when a keeper executes
\* an autonomous coding task — IF/WHEN such a runtime exists.
\*
\* Verifies properties that unit tests cannot:
\*   - Path traversal safety (writes always inside workspace boundary)
\*   - Identity consistency (all commits use same keeper identity)
\*   - No force push (force push never succeeds)
\*   - Review before submit (at least one review before PR creation)
\*   - No orphan workspaces (initialized workspaces always cleaned up)
\*
\* Mirrors a target work-pipeline runtime, not current production code.
