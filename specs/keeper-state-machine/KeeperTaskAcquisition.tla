---- MODULE KeeperTaskAcquisition ----
\* Task acquisition control flow for [lib/keeper/keeper_unified_turn.ml]
\* [run_keeper_cycle].  That function carries the reverse-direction
\* citation: a "Spec navigation (OCaml -> TLA+)" block names this module
\* and maps each action (SubmitTask / AssignTask / EmptyQueueSleep /
\* TurnComplete / TaskRejected) onto the corresponding code path — the
\* AssignTask -> "turn" channel decision is the
\* [observation.pending_mentions <> [] \/ observation.pending_board_events <> [] \/
\* observation.pending_scope_messages <> []] guard inside that function
\* (the literal payload is in [keeper_world_observation.ml], where the
\* [observation.pending_*] record fields are dereferenced).  The OCaml
\* side also carries a runtime guard for one producer path:
\* [keeper_keepalive_signal.ml]'s [post_submit_task] has
\* [@@fsm_guard "meta.Keeper_types.current_task_id = Some task_id"], invoked from
\* [keeper_keepalive.ml]'s [assign_keeper_task_from_directive] (the
\* operator "claim:<task_id>" directive) after [persist_directive_meta_update]
\* — see "Producer paths" below for why that path is a fused
\* SubmitTask+AssignTask in spec terms.
\*
\* iter 64 N-2.a removed line numbers — function names are stable, line
\* numbers drift; N-2.c adds a structural guard at
\* scripts/audit-tla-ml-line-refs.sh.  Re-verified iter 91, 2026-05-12.
\*
\* The OCaml runtime composes task acquisition out of three pieces:
\*   1. Producers append tasks to the backlog observable from
\*      [Keeper_world_observation] ([Coord.read_backlog] ->
\*      [observation.pending_*]).
\*   2. The keepalive fiber synthesises a [world_observation] for the
\*      next cycle and hands it to [run_keeper_cycle].
\*   3. [run_keeper_cycle] picks an actionable item from that
\*      observation, transitions the keeper to "running", drives the
\*      turn, and returns the keeper to idle.
\*
\* Producer paths.  There are two ways a task enters the system, and
\* this spec's SubmitTask abstracts the common effect of both:
\*   (a) backlog producer (supervisor / board posts) —
\*       a task lands in [Coord.read_backlog] and shows up as a
\*       [pending_*] item on the next [world_observation]; the keeper
\*       claims it via the "turn" channel (= spec's AssignTask).
\*   (b) operator "claim:<task_id>" directive — bypasses the backlog,
\*       writes [current_task_id] directly via
\*       [assign_keeper_task_from_directive] and wakes the keeper.  In
\*       spec terms this is a fused SubmitTask+AssignTask in one step
\*       (the [post_submit_task] [@@fsm_guard] enforces the
\*       [current_task_id] write half).  The spec does not track
\*       [current_task_id] — it only models the queue/turn-state/counter
\*       effect, which is the same for both paths.
\*
\* This spec collapses that pipeline into the abstract claim-and-finish
\* behaviour relevant to safety: every task that is *claimed* must
\* eventually be *finished*. A claim that is silently dropped without
\* a finish is what the boundary critique called a "task acquisition
\* black box" — visible as a queue that drains while no work shows up
\* in the keeper transition audit.
\*
\* Cycle 8 / Tier B2 of the Kimi keeper FSM review plan.
\*
\* Bug-Model contract (CLAUDE.md software-development.md):
\*   Spec      under KeeperTaskAcquisition.cfg       => TLC: no error.
\*   SpecBuggy under KeeperTaskAcquisition-buggy.cfg => TLC: invariant
\*                                                     violated.
\* Both must hold.

\* ── Honest actions ─────────────────────────────────────────────

\* A task enters the system. Covers both producer paths (see "Producer
\* paths" in the header): the backlog-producer append
\* ([Coord.read_backlog] -> next [world_observation.pending_*]) and the
\* operator "claim:<task_id>" directive ([assign_keeper_task_from_directive],
\* whose [post_submit_task] [@@fsm_guard] pins the [current_task_id]
\* write). The spec tracks only the queue-depth effect, which is common
\* to both. Bounded by MaxTasks so TLC has a finite reachable state space.
SubmitTask ==
    /\ queue_depth < MaxTasks
    /\ queue_depth' = queue_depth + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED << turn_state, tasks_claimed, tasks_completed >>

\* The keepalive fiber observes a non-empty backlog while the keeper
\* is idle and dispatches [run_keeper_cycle] with a world_observation
\* that names a concrete task. The [tasks_claimed < MaxTasks] guard
\* keeps the bounded run finite — TLC otherwise wraps queue cycles
\* around forever.
AssignTask ==
    /\ queue_depth > 0
    /\ turn_state = "idle"
    /\ tasks_claimed < MaxTasks
    /\ queue_depth' = queue_depth - 1
    /\ turn_state' = "running"
    /\ tasks_claimed' = tasks_claimed + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED tasks_completed

\* The turn finishes; the claimed task is recorded as done. The
\* counters move in lockstep, so the invariants below stay tight.
TurnComplete ==
    /\ turn_state = "running"
    /\ turn_state' = "idle"
    /\ tasks_completed' = tasks_completed + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED << queue_depth, tasks_claimed >>

\* Idle keeper observes an empty queue. Stutter — nothing to do.
EmptyQueueSleep ==
    /\ queue_depth = 0
    /\ turn_state = "idle"
    /\ UNCHANGED vars

\* Stutter step so TLC does not flag deadlock in the absorbing
\* states. Two cases enable stutter:
\*   - (queue=0, idle, claimed=completed): everything is reconciled,
\*     no work to do.
\*   - (claimed=MaxTasks, idle, completed=claimed): we have hit the
\*     bounded-run saturation point; no further AssignTask is
\*     possible, but the trailing queue items remain a legitimate
\*     state (in production they would be consumed in the next run).
Done ==
    /\ turn_state = "idle"
    /\ tasks_claimed = tasks_completed
    /\ (queue_depth = 0 \/ tasks_claimed = MaxTasks)
    /\ UNCHANGED vars

\* ── Bug action (only in SpecBuggy) ─────────────────────────────

\* Models the "task rejected" failure: the keeper claims a task
\* (decrementing the queue and bumping tasks_claimed) but never
\* completes it. In the OCaml runtime this maps to paths where
\* [run_keeper_cycle] returns Ok meta on a non-executable phase or a
\* livelock-blocked turn — the queue moved but the audit trail does
\* not show a corresponding completion.
\*
\* The action drops the keeper back to idle without bumping
\* tasks_completed. The counter mismatch makes the failure visible
\* to the safety invariants below.
TaskRejected ==
    /\ queue_depth > 0
    /\ turn_state = "idle"
    /\ tasks_claimed < MaxTasks
    /\ queue_depth' = queue_depth - 1
    /\ tasks_claimed' = tasks_claimed + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED << turn_state, tasks_completed >>   \* finishes never

\* ── Safety invariants ─────────────────────────────────────────

\* Core safety: at most one task is in flight at a time. Under the
\* clean Next, tasks_claimed bumps only via AssignTask which also
\* sets turn_state to "running"; TurnComplete bumps tasks_completed
\* and returns to idle. Therefore tasks_claimed - tasks_completed is
\* either 0 (idle, no in-flight) or 1 (running, one in-flight).
NoTaskOrphan ==
    tasks_claimed - tasks_completed <= 1

\* Quiescent state must be fully reconciled: when the queue is empty
\* and the keeper is idle, every claimed task must have been
\* completed. TaskRejected violates this — after the bug, the keeper
\* returns to idle with an empty queue but tasks_claimed >
\* tasks_completed. This is the silent-state form of the bug.
QuiescentImpliesCompleted ==
    (queue_depth = 0 /\ turn_state = "idle")
        => tasks_claimed = tasks_completed

\* In-flight accounting must match the FSM: a "running" keeper has
\* exactly one outstanding claim; an "idle" keeper has none. This
\* catches a different shape of the bug where the keeper goes
\* "running" without bumping tasks_claimed, or returns to "idle"
\* without bumping tasks_completed.
InFlightMatchesFSM ==
    /\ (turn_state = "running") => (tasks_claimed - tasks_completed = 1)
    /\ (turn_state = "idle")    => (tasks_claimed - tasks_completed = 0)
