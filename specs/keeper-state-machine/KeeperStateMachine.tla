---- MODULE KeeperStateMachine ----
\* Keeper 12-State Machine — TLA+ Formal Specification (RFC-0002)
\*
\* Models the deterministic core (Layer 2) of the keeper lifecycle.
\* Conditions (16 booleans) are primitive; Phase is derived via DerivePhase.
\* Events update conditions; DerivePhase projects the new phase.
\*
\* Verifies temporal properties that unit tests cannot:
\*   - Terminal permanence (Dead/Stopped are forever)
\*   - Deadlock freedom (non-terminal states always have enabled events)
\*   - Liveness (Failing, Overflowed eventually resolve)
\*   - Budget monotonicity (restart_budget_remaining never revives)
\*   - Overflowed transitions bounded (auto-compact or Paused, never loops)
\*
\* Mirrors: lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml

\* L6: Overflowed eventually resolves — either the auto-compact succeeds
\*     (→ Running via Compacting) or the retry latch promotes to Paused.

\* ── Bug Model: CompactionCompleted forgets to clear context_overflow ──
\*
\* Intent: demonstrate that CompactionClearsOverflow has discriminating
\* power.  If a future refactor breaks the condition-reset contract in
\* CompactionCompleted (for example, by forgetting to clear context_overflow),
\* the keeper re-enters Overflowed on the very next DerivePhase call even
\* though compaction succeeded.  TLC must report a counterexample that
\* violates CompactionClearsOverflow (compaction completed but
\* context_overflow remains true).
\*
\* Used by: KeeperStateMachine-overflow-buggy.cfg (SPECIFICATION SpecBuggy)

BuggyCompactionCompleted ==
    /\ NotTerminal /\ compaction_active
    /\ compaction_active' = FALSE
    \* BUG: the primed values of context_overflow and compact_retry_exhausted
    \* are omitted, so those flags stay set after the compaction claims to
    \* have resolved the overflow.
