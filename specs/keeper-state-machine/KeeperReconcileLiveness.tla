---- MODULE KeeperReconcileLiveness ----
\* HISTORICAL AUDIT MODEL ONLY — NOT part of the canonical keeper runtime set.
\*
\* Current authoritative keeper FSM set:
\*   - KeeperStateMachine.tla
\*   - KeeperCompositeLifecycle.tla
\*   - KeeperTurnCycle.tla
\*   - KeeperDecisionPipeline.tla
\*   - KeeperCascadeLifecycle.tla
\*   - KeeperCompactionLifecycle.tla
\*   - boundary/KeeperContinueGate.tla
\*
\* This module is retained as a forensic model for the old two-store
\* manual_reconcile one-way trap. It does not describe the current
\* runtime-owned contract and should not be used as the SSOT for live
\* keeper behavior.
\*
\* Keeper Reconcile Liveness — TLA+ Specification
\*
\* Verifies that manual_reconcile_required is not a one-way trap:
\* once set, the system can always eventually clear it.
\*
\* Background (masc-mcp#6841+):
\*   manual_reconcile_required was set to TRUE by OAS bridge failures
\*   (committed external side effects during cascade errors), but the
\*   heartbeat recovery path only dispatched Turn_succeeded without
\*   dispatching Manual_reconcile_cleared.  Since Turn_succeeded does
\*   NOT clear manual_reconcile_required in the OCaml FSM (only
\*   Manual_reconcile_cleared and Fiber_started do), the flag stayed
\*   TRUE forever, permanently trapping the keeper in Failing.
\*
\* HISTORICAL NOTE (#8987): The IMPORTANT block below references a
\* discrepancy that no longer exists -- the manual_reconcile_required
\* mechanism has been REMOVED ENTIRELY from both the canonical spec
\* and the OCaml impl (verified: zero occurrences in
\* specs/keeper-state-machine/KeeperStateMachine.tla and
\* lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml as of 2026-04-20).  The audit
\* model is retained as a forensic record of the design lesson:
\* recovery actions must clear ALL latches that block their target
\* state, not just the most obvious one.  The named TurnSucceeded /
\* manual_reconcile_required interaction is inactive.
\*
\* Original IMPORTANT (no longer applies to the current canonical spec):
\* The existing KeeperStateMachine.tla has a model-to-code
\* discrepancy: its TurnSucceeded action sets manual_reconcile_required'
\* = FALSE, which masks this bug.  This spec models the OCaml behavior
\* faithfully: TurnSucceeded does NOT clear manual_reconcile_required.
\*
\* Key properties:
\*   L1 ManualReconcileLiveness:   blocked => eventually unblocked
\*   L2 FailingRecoveryLiveness:   Failing => eventually Running (or terminal)
\*   L3 HeartbeatRecoveryAtomic:   recovery dispatches BOTH Turn_succeeded
\*                                 AND Manual_reconcile_cleared
\*
\* Bug model: recovery only dispatches Turn_succeeded (old code).
\* The liveness property MUST be violated in the buggy variant.
\*
\* Mirrors: lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml (update_conditions)
\*          lib/keeper/keeper_heartbeat_snapshot.ml:write_heartbeat_snapshot (heartbeat recovery)

\* Issue #8642/#8701 family: explicit OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping. SSOT for
\* OCaml side is lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml (13 phases;
\* Zombie added iter 4 #14707).  This spec uses the same CamelCase
\* constructor names as the OCaml type
\* but only models the 6 phases relevant to reconcile liveness — the
\* phases the supervisor must drive to a stable state. Mapping
\* (CamelCase identical to OCaml constructors):
\*
\*   "Stopped"  ↔ Stopped       \*  Terminal
\*   "Dead"     ↔ Dead          \*  Terminal
\*   "Running"  ↔ Running       \*  Stable (live)
\*   "Paused"   ↔ Paused        \*  Stable (operator-held)
\*   "Crashed"  ↔ Crashed       \*  Stable (awaiting supervisor)
\*   "Offline"  ↔ Offline       \*  Stable (cold)
\*
\* Unmodeled here (covered in companion specs):
\*   Failing, Overflowed, Compacting, HandingOff, Draining, Restarting,
\*   Zombie
\*   See KeeperCoreTriad.tla and KeeperContextLifecycle.tla.
\*   Zombie (added iter 4 #14707) is terminal-terminal: it is reached
\*   only post-Dead when supervisor cleanup latches a never-cleared
\*   failure, so no reconcile-liveness driving is possible.  Safety
\*   surface lives in KeeperStateMachine.tla (ZombieIsForever /
\*   ZombieRequiresTerminalFailureLatched).
