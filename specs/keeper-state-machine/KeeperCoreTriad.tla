---- MODULE KeeperCoreTriad ----
\* Keeper Core Triad — State x Decision x Cascade Unified Specification
\*
\* Composes three independently-verified subsystems into a single model
\* to verify cross-cutting safety and liveness properties:
\*
\*   State Machine  (KeeperStateMachine.tla)   — keeper phase lifecycle
\*   Decision       (KeeperDecisionPipeline.tla) — guard/tool policy
\*   Cascade        (CascadeExhaustion.tla)    — provider fallback
\*
\* Key properties verified:
\*   S1 NoTerminalCascade:       terminal phase => no cascade active
\*   S2 FailingUsesRecovery:     Failing => local_recovery cascade only
\*   S3 CapabilityGateHolds:     active attempt => ceiling >= requested
\*   S4 SideEffectContainment:   committed side effect + error => partial
\*   S5 PhaseDecisionConsistency: active turn => cascade selected
\*
\* Bug model: BugSelectCascade removes phase-aware routing, reproducing
\* the Groq max_tokens ceiling violation (masc-mcp#6686).
\*
\* Mirrors: lib/keeper/keeper_cascade_routing.ml (SelectCascade action)
\*          lib/cascade_inference.ml (CapabilityGate action)
\*          lib/keeper/keeper_unified_turn.ml (turn lifecycle)
\*
\* OCaml mapping:
\*   phase              <-> Keeper_state_machine.phase (13-phase OCaml type
\*                          projected to a 7-symbol triad alphabet; see the
\*                          canonical mapping in the TypeOK preamble below.
\*                          Zombie added iter 4 #14707 is terminal post-Dead
\*                          (outside the turn cycle) and collapses into the
\*                          7-phase projection's "Stable" symbol — same arm
\*                          as Offline / Paused / Stopped / Crashed /
\*                          Restarting / Dead.  See KeeperCompositeLifecycle
\*                          Comment A for the canonical 13->7 mapping
\*                          (referred to as "Terminal" shorthand earlier in
\*                          some prose; the projection symbol is "Stable").)
\*   effective_cascade  <-> Keeper_cascade_routing.select_cascade result
\*   provider_ceiling   <-> Oas_model_resolve.resolve_max_cascade_context
\*   requested_max_tokens <-> Cascade_inference.resolve_max_tokens
\*
\* (The canonical 13->7 phase mapping lives next to PhaseSet in this file
\*  (KeeperCompositeLifecycle Comment A is the SSOT).  Pre-Zombie this
\*  was "12->7"; iter 4 #14707 added Zombie which folds into the "Stable"
\*  symbol via the iter 51 #14865 mapping update.
\*  An earlier version of this preamble carried a separate "Phase
\*  simplification (12 -> 7)" mapping that classified HandingOff / Paused /
\*  Restarting differently from the canonical one.  Removed in #8970 to
\*  avoid the self-contradiction that TLC could not surface.)

\* ── Type Invariant ───────────────────────────────────────

\* Issue #8642/#8701 family: explicit OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping. SSOT for
\* OCaml side is lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml (13 phases;
\* Zombie added iter 4 #14707).  This spec collapses the 12 non-Zombie
\* phases into a 7-symbol "core triad" alphabet
\* because the triad invariants only depend on running/failure/
\* compaction signals, not on the full keeper lifecycle. Mapping:
\*
\*   "Running"     ↔ Running
\*   "Failing"     ↔ Failing
\*   "Overflowed"  ↔ Overflowed
\*   "Compacting"  ↔ Compacting
\*   "HandingOff"  ↔ HandingOff
\*   "Draining"    ↔ Draining
\*   "Terminal"    ↔ Offline | Paused | Stopped | Crashed | Restarting | Dead | Zombie
\*
\* Zombie (added iter 4 #14707) is terminal-terminal: reached only
\* post-Dead when supervisor cleanup latches a never-cleared failure
\* (see ZombieIsForever / ZombieRequiresTerminalFailureLatched in
\* KeeperStateMachine.tla).  Collapsed into "Terminal" because the
\* core triad invariants do not distinguish Dead from Zombie — both
\* are terminal-with-no-progress for the running/failure/compaction
\* axes this spec tracks.
\*
\* Unmodeled here (covered in companion specs):
\*   none (all 13 OCaml phases are represented in the 7-symbol triad)

\* ── Phase Transitions ────────────────────────────────────
\* Simplified from KeeperStateMachine.tla: only transitions relevant
\* to cascade routing behavior. Full phase verification is delegated
\* to the existing KeeperStateMachine spec.

\* Phase transitions only occur between turns (Eio cooperative scheduling:
\* heartbeat events are dispatched at loop boundaries, not during OAS calls).
\* Guard: turn_status must be "idle" or "done" for phase to change.

\* BecomeRunning is removed as a standalone action — it is driven by
\* TurnComplete feedback (turn success in Failing -> Running).
\* This mirrors OCaml: derive_phase returns Running when turn_healthy=true.

\*
\* CASCADE NAME ABSTRACTION (S1/S2/S3-buffer)
\* ----------------------------------------
\* The string literals "none", "local_recovery", and "local_only" used below
\* are SPEC-LEVEL CANONICAL ROLE NAMES, not literal OCaml return values.
\*
\* On the OCaml side (`lib/keeper/keeper_cascade_routing.ml` +
\* `lib/cascade/cascade_routes.ml`), cascade names are resolved through a
\* typed `logical_use` enum (`Phase_recovery`, `Phase_buffer`) and a
\* prioritised resolution chain in `cascade_name_for_use`:
\*   (a) operator-supplied `routes.<key>` binding, if its target exists
\*       in the live catalog;
\*   (b) first catalog entry name (the boot-time default profile);
\*   (c) `route_spec.aliases` first element, or the route key — *only*
\*       when the catalog is empty (a state boot validation rejects).
\* The literal string produced at runtime depends on operator catalog and
\* routes (RFC-0058 declarative route mapping); only the *default empty
\* catalog* boot path produces the literal strings written below.
\*
\* The invariants below are written as TLA+ string equalities, but those
\* literals should be read as canonical *role identifiers* — they stand
\* in for the typed `logical_use` role that production resolves through
\* the chain above:
\*   - "none"           ↔ "no cascade is active for this turn"
\*   - "local_recovery" ↔ `Phase_recovery` role
\*   - "local_only"     ↔ `Phase_buffer` role
\* TLC still compares strings; the *semantic* claim is role identity.
\* See `docs/tla-audit/kct-c3-terminal-cascade-contract-gap-2026-05-12.md`
\* and `docs/tla-audit/kct-s2s3-failing-buffer-cascade-alignment-2026-05-12.md`
\* (the latter lands via PR #14787) for the production indirection
\* analysis.

\* S1: Terminal phase never has an active cascade.
\* OCaml note: `select_cascade` returns `base_cascade` for terminal phases
\* (paper contract gap — caller graph upstream-gates the call so the value
\* is unreachable in production).  See C-3 audit memo above.
NoTerminalCascade ==
    phase = "Terminal" => effective_cascade = "none"

\* S2: Cascade selection in Failing phase must yield the Phase_recovery role.
\* Note: if a keeper transitions to Failing MID-TURN, the already-selected
\* cascade remains — cascade is chosen at turn start, not re-evaluated.
\* This invariant checks the selection action, not the runtime state.
\* OCaml: `Failing -> Keeper_config.local_recovery_cascade_name`, which
\* resolves through `Phase_recovery` route — string match only in the
\* default catalog.  See S2/S3 audit memo above.
FailingUsesRecovery ==
    (phase = "Failing" /\ turn_status = "selecting"
     /\ effective_cascade /= "none") =>
        effective_cascade = "local_recovery"

\* S3 (buffer): Cascade selection in buffer-operation phases must yield
\* the Phase_buffer role.  OCaml:
\* `Compacting | HandingOff -> Keeper_config.local_only_cascade_name`,
\* which resolves through `Phase_buffer` route.  See S2/S3 audit memo.
BufferOpsUseLocalOnly ==
    (phase \in {"Compacting", "HandingOff"} /\ turn_status = "selecting"
     /\ effective_cascade /= "none") =>
        effective_cascade = "local_only"

\* S3: Active provider attempt respects ceiling
\* After clamping, requested_max_tokens <= provider ceiling
CapabilityGateHolds ==
    turn_status = "executing" =>
        requested_max_tokens <= ProviderCeiling(provider_idx)

\* S4: Side effect + error -> partial_commit (retry blocked)
SideEffectContainment ==
    (has_side_effect /\ turn_outcome \in {"error"}) => FALSE
    \* i.e., if side_effect is TRUE, outcome is never plain "error"
    \* it must be "partial_commit" instead

\* S5: Active turn has a cascade selected.
\*
\* Cascade-name abstraction: `"none"` here is the SPEC-LEVEL EMPTY-ROLE
\* SENTINEL — it asserts "no cascade is selected", not a literal string
\* match against an OCaml return value.  The OCaml side has no literal
\* "none" — `select_cascade` always returns a real cascade name (even for
\* terminal phases — see `docs/tla-audit/kct-c3-terminal-cascade-contract
\* -gap-2026-05-12.md`); the empty-role assertion is preserved
\* STRUCTURALLY by the caller graph upstream gating the call for non-
\* active turn_status values.
\*
\* The invariant therefore captures a structural property: the dispatch
\* table in `lib/keeper/keeper_cascade_routing.ml` returns a non-empty
\* cascade name for all phases that can co-occur with
\* turn_status in {selecting, executing, retrying}, namely
\* {Running, Failing, Compacting, HandingOff}.
