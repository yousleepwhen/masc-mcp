---- MODULE KeeperOutcomesConservation ----
\* Keeper outcomes ledger conservation invariant.
\*
\* This spec models the arithmetic identity the Agent Modal's
\* "결과 / 실패 / 검증" section relies on:
\*
\*     successes + failures + rejected = observed_turns
\*
\* Each observed turn lands in exactly one outcome bucket.  The rollup
\* endpoint (dashboard_http_keeper.ml outcomes block in the redesign
\* plan) aggregates over keeper_transition_audit + keeper_compact_audit
\* + trajectory gate decisions.  If any source double-counts a turn
\* (e.g. a rollover fires both a success and a failure record) or any
\* source under-counts (e.g. a rejection doesn't increment the denom),
\* the rate displayed to the observer becomes untruthful.
\*
\* Guarantees:
\*   ConservationLaw — s + f + r = observed_turns at every state.
\*   MonotoneLedger  — none of the counters ever decrease.
\*   TypeOK          — variables stay in bounded domains.
\*
\* Bug Model (feedback_tla-spec-audit-outcome-trichotomy):
\*   Clean cfg : Safety (TypeOK + ConservationLaw) holds.
\*   Buggy cfg : BuggyDoubleBucket categorises a single turn into two
\*               buckets (successes ∧ failures on the same turn),
\*               bumping both but observed_turns only once.
\*               ConservationLaw MUST be violated.
\*
\* OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping (see #8642 family).  Symbol-anchored, no line
\* numbers — iter 64 N-2.a convention; the previous "lines 81/82/89"
\* anchors had all drifted, and "observed_turns = succ_turns + fail_turn"
\* was a stale 2-bucket form (the runtime is now 3-bucket).  All three
\* refs live inside [compute_outcomes_rollup] in
\* lib/dashboard/dashboard_http_keeper.ml:
\*
\*   spec variable    | OCaml ref / counter (inside compute_outcomes_rollup)
\*   -----------------+----------------------------------------------------
\*   successes        | `succ_turns` ref — incr when a completed_turn_record
\*                    | has outcome [Keeper_transition_audit.Turn_substantive]
\*   failures         | `fail_turn` ref — incr on [Turn_failed]
\*   rejected         | `fail_gate_rejected` ref — incr on [Turn_gate_rejected]
\*                    | (NO LONGER always 0; see "Runtime status" below)
\*   observed_turns   | `List.length completed_turns` — the size of the
\*                    | [Keeper_transition_audit.recent_completed_turns]
\*                    | 50-entry ring; the three buckets partition exactly
\*                    | this list, so conservation holds by construction
\*
\* Aggregation entry point:
\*   lib/dashboard/dashboard_http_keeper.ml — [compute_outcomes_rollup],
\*   called from the per-keeper detail JSON builder.  Its doc-comment
\*   cites {!KeeperOutcomesConservation.tla} and states the same law:
\*     successes.substantive_turns + failures.turn_failed + failures.gate_rejected
\*       = observed_turns
\*   "holds by construction because all three turn buckets now come from
\*    the same completed-turn ring."
\*
\* Runtime status (2026-05-12, iter 79 R-6 — supersedes the old "SCOPE
\* DRIFT" note that said r is always 0):
\*   The third bucket has landed.  `fail_gate_rejected` is a live counter,
\*   incremented when a completed-turn record carries the [Turn_gate_rejected]
\*   outcome, and `observed_turns = List.length completed_turns` counts every
\*   record — so `gate_rejected` increments inherently bump the denominator
\*   (they're the same list, not separate sources).  The spec's 3-bucket
\*   ConservationLaw is therefore load-bearing now, not vacuous, and the
\*   OCaml satisfies it by construction.  The old advice ("anyone wiring the
\*   third bucket should run the spec's clean AND buggy cfgs") was followed —
\*   this entry is the retrospective confirmation.
\*
\* Out-of-scope counters (intentionally not modelled here):
\*   - succ_compactions / fail_compaction / succ_handoffs / fail_handoff
\*     are tracked separately in the same OCaml function but live on a
\*     different axis (per-mechanism, not per-turn). They do NOT affect
\*     observed_turns.
\*   - keeper_verdicts (pass / fail / unknown from harness verdicts) live
\*     in a sibling read model.

VARIABLES
    successes,

vars == << successes, failures, rejected, observed_turns >>

TypeOK ==
    /\ successes      \in 0..MaxTurns
    /\ failures       \in 0..MaxTurns

\* ── Actions ─────────────────────────────────

\* A substantive turn is observed: exactly one bucket is chosen and
\* observed_turns advances in lockstep.  The three success paths are
\* intentionally separate actions to mirror the state machine events
\* (Turn_succeeded / Turn_failed / Gate_rejected).

SuccessfulTurn ==
    /\ observed_turns < MaxTurns
    /\ successes'      = successes + 1
    /\ observed_turns' = observed_turns + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED << failures, rejected >>

FailedTurn ==
    /\ observed_turns < MaxTurns
    /\ failures'       = failures + 1
    /\ observed_turns' = observed_turns + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED << successes, rejected >>

RejectedTurn ==
    /\ observed_turns < MaxTurns
    /\ rejected'       = rejected + 1
    /\ observed_turns' = observed_turns + 1
    /\ UNCHANGED << successes, failures >>

\* ── Safety ──────────────────────────────────

\* Core identity: every observed turn is accounted for in exactly one
\* outcome bucket.  This is what makes pass-rate percentages
\* (successes / observed_turns) meaningful.
ConservationLaw ==
    successes + failures + rejected = observed_turns

\* Sanity: an outcome ledger never retracts a recorded outcome.
MonotoneLedger ==
    /\ successes      >= 0
    /\ failures       >= 0
    /\ rejected       >= 0
    /\ observed_turns >= 0

\* ── Bug Model ───────────────────────────────

\* Mutation: a single observed turn is categorised into two buckets at
\* once.  In the real rollup this would happen if, say, a turn that
\* failed after a tool call also fires a Gate_rejected event and the
\* aggregator naively adds both.  observed_turns advances by 1 but
\* successes + failures advance by 2 ⇒ ConservationLaw fails.
BuggyDoubleBucket ==
    /\ observed_turns < MaxTurns
    /\ successes'      = successes + 1
