---- MODULE KeeperCompositeLifecycle ----
\* Keeper Composite Lifecycle — Cross-spec Joint Invariants (Observer)
\*
\* Purpose
\*   The repository already has three partial composition specs:
\*     - KeeperCoreTriad.tla          State x Decision x Cascade (7-phase projection)
\*     - StateProduct.tla             Keeper x Turn x Validation
\*     - KeeperContextLifecycle.tla   Context + Compaction + Checkpoint + Recovery
\*   None of them check joint invariants that span all four domain FSMs
\*   (Decision, CascadeLifecycle, CompactionLifecycle, parent phase) together, nor
\*   does any spec model the exact projected turn/decision/cascade state
\*   sequence now surfaced by the runtime observer.
\*
\*   This spec is an OBSERVER, not a new controller. It declares a minimum
\*   set of projected variables — each traceable to an OCaml module — and
\*   asserts joint invariants that no existing spec covers. It does not
\*   redefine the transitions of any sub-FSM; they are represented only at
\*   the resolution required for the joint properties.
\*
\*   Related audit: docs/tla-audit/state-fsm-gap-2026-04-13.md (proposals
\*   P1, P3, P4 — this spec absorbs P4 and encodes P3's clearing property).
\*
\* Design intent
\*   1. shared_measurement is the coordination hub (Context_measured event,
\*      Keeper_state_machine.mli — [Context_measured] constructor of
\*      [type event], auto_rules_summary). Cite by symbol — iter 64 N-2.a
\*      (line numbers drift on every edit; [type event] / [Context_measured]
\*      are stable identifiers, the OCaml compiler keeps them honest).
\*      Adjacent NoDrainTransition / GhostDispatch *.mli docstring callouts
\*      are anchored similarly by name, not by line number.
\*   2. The 13-state parent phase from RFC-0002 is projected to the
\*      7-element set
\*      {Running, Failing, Overflowed, Compacting, HandingOff, Draining,
\*       Stable}
\*      — exactly the phases that matter for cross-spec ordering.
\*      (See Comment A for the explicit 13->7 mapping; the 7 phases that
\*      collapse to "Stable" are out of scope for the joint invariants
\*      because they sit outside the turn cycle.)
\*   3. Parent-lifecycle recovery is modeled directly as Running/Failing
\*      phase transitions; legacy two-store recovery placeholders are
\*      intentionally excluded from this observer.
\*   4. Model size kept small on purpose; TLC over this spec should
\*      complete in seconds, not hours.
\*
\* Non-goals (enforced structurally — see Boundary comment at end)
\*   - No transition of KSM/KTC/KDP/KMC/KCL is redefined here.
\*   - No provider/model identifier appears at any step.
\*   - No token counting happens in this spec (OAS owns budget math).

\* ── Projected state variables ────────────────────────────
\* Each variable below is a PROJECTION of state owned by another spec or
\* OCaml module. The mapping is explicit and one-way; this spec never
\* writes back.

VARIABLES
    ksm_phase,          \* KSM projection. KeeperStateMachine.tla phase
                        \* Reduced to the 7 values that change cross-spec
                        \* behavior (6 active + Stable absorber).
                        \* Mapping from 12-state OCaml phase is in Comment A.

    ktc_turn_phase,     \* KTC projection. KeeperTurnCycle.tla / unified turn
                        \* Values: idle, prompting, executing, compacting,
                        \*         finalizing.

    kdp_decision,       \* KDP projection. KeeperDecisionPipeline.tla
                        \* Values: undecided, guard_ok, gate_rejected,
                        \*         tool_policy_selected.

    kcl_cascade_state,  \* KCL projection. keeper-facing cascade lifecycle
                        \* Values: idle, selecting, trying, done, exhausted.

    kmc_compaction,     \* KMC projection. keeper-facing compaction lifecycle
                        \* Values: accumulating, compacting, done.

    shared_measurement, \* Coordination hub. auto_rules_summary snapshot id
                        \* (Nat); 0 means "no measurement yet this turn".

    measurement_turn,   \* Turn tick at which current shared_measurement
                        \* was captured. Guards "measurement before cascade".

    turn_tick,          \* Monotone counter used for ordering checks.

    \* ── RFC-0065 Phase 5.1.b projections ────────────────────
    \* Three new sub-FSM projections coupled into this observer per
    \* RFC-0065 §3.4.  Each is the smallest abstraction sufficient
    \* for one joint invariant; the detailed transitions belong to
    \* their owning specs (KeeperCascadeAttemptFSM, KeeperToolSurface,
    \* KeeperPostTurnOrchestration).

    kcaf_attempt_phase, \* B1 (KeeperCascadeAttemptFSM) projection.
                        \* Values: "idle", "attempting", "terminal".
                        \* Source spec: KeeperCascadeAttemptFSM.tla — its
                        \* full 6-phase enum (idle/attempting/awaiting_
                        \* response/success/exhausted_normal/exhausted_
                        \* hard_quota) collapses to 3 here.

    kts_surface_ready,  \* B2 (KeeperToolSurface) projection.
                        \* BOOLEAN — TRUE iff the tool-surface pipeline
                        \* has produced a non-empty emitted set this
                        \* turn.  Mirrors KeeperToolSurface.tla phase =
                        \* "computed" with emitted /= {}.

    kpto_phase          \* B3 (KeeperPostTurnOrchestration) projection.
                        \* Values: "idle", "active", "persisted".
                        \* "active" covers the wirein A5→A6→K4b→K1 +
                        \* lineage append run; "persisted" covers
                        \* checkpoint persist.  Source spec:
                        \* KeeperPostTurnOrchestration.tla.

\* ── Enumerated value sets ───────────────────────────────

\* Comment A — 13->7 phase projection (from RFC-0002 Transition Matrix
\* + Zombie extension added iter 4 #14707):
\*   Running     -> Running
\*   Failing     -> Failing
\*   Overflowed  -> Overflowed     (added 2026-04, MASC-1)
\*   Compacting  -> Compacting
\*   HandingOff  -> HandingOff
\*   Draining    -> Draining
\*   Offline, Paused, Stopped, Crashed, Restarting, Dead, Zombie -> Stable
\*                                                       (Zombie added iter 4
\*                                                        #14707 — terminal
\*                                                        post-Dead, outside
\*                                                        the turn cycle ⇒
\*                                                        structurally Stable)
\* This is a LOSSY projection; the joint invariants here hold for all
\* states that collapse to Stable by construction (they are outside the
\* turn cycle). Overflowed is tracked as its own phase because it couples
\* KSM with KMC (memory compaction) via the Start_compaction entry action.

\* TurnPhaseSet: KTC projection.  iter 39 R-E-1.a (2026-05-12) sync —
\* KTC.tla:127 widened to 7 members in iter 28 (#14793 R-B-1.a) to match
\* OCaml's 7-constructor `Keeper_registry.turn_phase`; KCL had carried
\* the pre-iter-28 5-member set, creating a cross-spec drift documented
\* in `docs/tla-audit/kcl-e1-cross-spec-projection-drift-2026-05-12.md`
\* (PR #14822 Finding 1, HIGH risk).  Type widening only — KCL's existing
\* observer actions don't transition into routing/exhausted; per-attempt
\* FSM is owned by KCAF and the keeper-projection action set by KTC
\* (B-2 audit #14809).  Action modeling deferred — see KTC R-B-2.{a,b,c}.

\* KcafPhaseSet: DELIBERATE 3:6 projection collapse from KCAF.tla:79-81.
\* iter 39 R-E-1.c (2026-05-12, this commit) documents the mapping per
\* iter 38 KCL E-1 Finding 2 (PR #14822):
\*
\*   KCL abstract      ↔  KCAF concrete
\*   "idle"            ↔  "idle"
\*   "attempting"      ↔  "attempting", "awaiting_response"
\*   "terminal"        ↔  "success", "exhausted_normal", "exhausted_hard_quota"
\*
\* The terminal collapse silently merges KCAF's distinguished terminals
\* (exhausted_normal vs exhausted_hard_quota documented in D-2 audit
\* #14815).  Joint invariants conditioning on `kcaf_attempt_phase` cannot
\* distinguish hard-quota from normal exhaustion at the cross-spec level
\* — the D-2 safety surface (HardQuotaTerminalImmediate +
\* BugHardQuotaBypass) lives only in KCAF, not in any KCL joint property.
\* This is INTENTIONAL: KCL operates at a coarser observation
\* granularity; per-terminal-flavor invariants belong in KCAF.

\* HandingOff orchestration (Gap-1 audit 2026-05-14).
\* Until this iteration KCL declared "HandingOff" in PhaseSet but never
\* transitioned into it, so the joint invariants conditioning on KSM phase
\* held vacuously for the entire HandingOff cross-section.  Modeling the
\* entry explicitly is what surfaces the mid-flight gap, and the
\* NoMidFlightTransitionToHandingOff invariant below pins the contract.
\*
\* Modeling note — quiescence preconditions.
\*   KCL is an OBSERVER, not a controller.  EnterHandingOff models the
\*   *desired contract*: OCaml must drive the in-flight cascade attempt
\*   to a terminal state (Eio cancel + termination) before HandingOff is
\*   observable in the joint state.  Encoding this as a precondition
\*   makes the contract explicit; the matching bug action
\*   (BugMidFlightHandoffEntry below) models the contract *violation*,
\*   so any TLC counter-example coming from the buggy spec is
\*   attributable to the bypass, not to a benign racing trace of the
\*   clean spec.  This is the spec-first stance: clean spec encodes
\*   what OCaml *must* uphold, bug action encodes the silent failure
\*   when OCaml does *not* uphold it.

\* ── Safety invariants (clean cfg must pass) ──────────────

\* I1 — PhaseTurnAlignment
\* When the parent phase is Compacting, the turn phase and memory phase
\* must also be in their compacting states. Encodes the post-turn
\* lifecycle atomicity in keeper_post_turn.ml — the post-turn lifecycle
\* orchestration (apply_post_turn_lifecycle_with_resilience_handles and
\* the compaction/rollover/wirein steps it sequences; cited by symbol,
\* not line — iter 64 N-2.a, converted in the iter 85 scattered-singles
\* line-ref sweep).
PhaseTurnAlignment ==
    (ksm_phase = "Compacting") =>
        (ktc_turn_phase = "compacting" /\ kmc_compaction = "compacting")

\* I2 — NoCascadeBeforeMeasurement
\* Cascade selection cannot advance past idle/selecting without a
\* measurement having been taken in the current turn.
NoCascadeBeforeMeasurement ==
    (kcl_cascade_state \in {"selecting", "trying", "done", "exhausted"}) =>
        (shared_measurement /= 0 /\ measurement_turn = turn_tick)

\* I3 — CompactionAtomicity
\* Memory compaction progress and parent Compacting phase stay consistent:
\* KMC cannot be in "compacting" while the parent is Running.
CompactionAtomicity ==
    (kmc_compaction = "compacting") =>
        (ksm_phase = "Compacting")

\* I4 — EventPriorityMonotone
\* The currently bound measurement must belong to the live turn. This is
\* the small-state observer projection of the runtime's stronger
\* measurement-bind monotonicity check.
EventPriorityMonotone ==
    (shared_measurement = 0) \/ (measurement_turn = turn_tick)

\* ── RFC-0065 Phase 5.1.b joint invariants ────────────────
\* Three predicates spanning the existing 5 sub-FSMs and the three new
\* RFC-0065 sub-FSMs (B1/B2/B3).  Per RFC §3.4 these stay weak —
\* predicates over projections only, no enumeration of the full
\* product state space.

\* I5 — AttemptFSMRespectsAdmission (RFC §3.4, historical name)
\* B1.KCAF cannot enter "attempting" unless the turn measurement hub has fired
\* in the current turn. The former MASC-side KeeperAdmissionLiveness provider
\* gate was retired; this projection now models the live turn-semaphore entry
\* signal only.
AttemptFSMRespectsAdmission ==
    (kcaf_attempt_phase = "attempting") =>
        (shared_measurement /= 0 /\ measurement_turn = turn_tick)

\* I6 — ToolSurfaceFeedsAttempt (RFC §3.4)
\* B2.KTS must have produced a non-empty surface (kts_surface_ready)
\* before B1.KCAF enters "attempting".  Models the producer/consumer
\* dependency: an empty surface cannot feed a cascade attempt.
ToolSurfaceFeedsAttempt ==
    (kcaf_attempt_phase = "attempting") => kts_surface_ready

\* I7 — PostTurnConsumesAttempt (RFC §3.4)
\* B3.KPTO begins only when B1.KCAF has reached a terminal state.
\* "active" must not be observed alongside an in-flight attempt;
\* either the cascade was not attempted this turn (kcaf = "idle")
\* or it terminated before post-turn started.
PostTurnConsumesAttempt ==
    (kpto_phase = "active") => (kcaf_attempt_phase /= "attempting")

\* ── Gap-1 invariant (audit 2026-05-14) ───────────────────
\* This invariant closes the "mid-flight transitional phase"
\* silent-failure family.  KCL previously declared HandingOff in
\* PhaseSet but had no action transitioning into it, so any joint
\* property conditioning on KSM=HandingOff held vacuously.  Adding
\* EnterHandingOff with quiescence preconditions makes that subspace
\* reachable, and I8 below pins the cross-FSM contract.  Pairs with
\* SpecBuggyMidFlightHandoff (BugMidFlightHandoffEntry) which models
\* the contract bypass — the silent failure path.

\* I8 — NoMidFlightTransitionToHandingOff
\* If KSM is in HandingOff, the turn cycle must be quiescent: no
\* attempting cascade, no in-flight cascade attempt (state in trying
\* or selecting), and the turn phase must not be in an active stage.
\* The clean spec preserves this by construction (EnterHandingOff
\* preconditions); the buggy spec violates it via the bypass action.
NoMidFlightTransitionToHandingOff ==
    (ksm_phase = "HandingOff") =>
