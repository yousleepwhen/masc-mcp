\* Spec scope (2026-05-12, iter 75 R-2.a — see docs/tla-audit/krd-r2-rollover-decision-spec-ocaml-verified-2026-05-12.md):
\*   The OCaml signal gate is a disjunction of TWO overflow signals:
\*     (a) ?current_turn_blocker_info — the in-flight turn's blocker (fires
\*         regardless of last_outcome), and
\*     (b) last_blocker_info gated on last_outcome = Proactive_error.
\*   This spec models only (b) via SignalFires.  (a) is intentionally omitted:
\*   it exercises the same typed predicate blocker_class_indicates_overflow on
\*   the same blocker_class set, so SignalGateOverflowOnly already covers it by
\*   construction (the spec under-approximates the trigger conditions, never
\*   over-approximates the safety guarantee).  If (a) ever grows class-specific
\*   behaviour, add it here as a second SignalFires disjunct + a Next variable.
\*
\* Architectural invariant:
\*   OAS/MASC treat provider/model as opaque aliases.  The keeper layer
\*   reasons only over typed blocker_class — substring matching at this
\*   layer is forbidden.  The SDK boundary (Keeper_status_bridge) is the
\*   sole adapter from wire-level phrasing to typed class.
\*
\*   Spec models classes as abstract symbols ("overflow", "non_overflow")
\*   to enforce opacity at the model checking level — class identifiers
\*   carry no provider semantics.
\*
\* Bug Model (CLAUDE.md §TLA+ Bug Model 패턴):
\*   Clean cfg: rollover Go fires iff (ratio_gate) OR (proactive_error AND
\*              overflow_class).  Other classes never trigger the signal gate.
\*   Buggy cfg: models the historical substring-match degradation where the
\*              gate fires on any non-empty blocker class regardless of
\*              overflow semantics.  Invariant SignalGateOverflowOnly MUST
\*              be violated.

\* Typed signal predicate — fires iff outcome was an error AND the
\* typed class is the overflow class.  This is the SAFE specification:
\* downstream rollover reasons over typed enum only.
SignalFires(outcome, klass) ==
    /\ outcome = "proactive_error"

           [] ~rg /\ sig   -> "go_signal"
           [] OTHER        -> "skip_below"

\* Decision function — BUGGY version: signal fires on any non-none class
\* during a proactive_error, regardless of whether the class is the
\* overflow class.  Mirrors the historical substring-match drift.
ComputeDecisionBuggy(ah, ce, rg, outcome, klass) ==
    IF ~ah THEN "skip_disabled"

    ELSE LET sig == (outcome = "proactive_error" /\ klass /= "none") IN

\* Safety: when the gate fires on signal (go_signal or go_both contribution),
\* the blocker class must be exactly "overflow".  Non-overflow classes must
\* never trigger the signal half of the gate.
SignalGateOverflowOnly ==
    decision \in {"go_signal", "go_both"} =>
        \/ decision = "go_both" /\ ~SignalFires(lastOutcome, lastBlockerClass)
            \* When go_both, the signal contribution may be absent;
            \* ratio gate alone justifies "go_both" only if signal also fired
            \* — which the clean spec guarantees by construction.  This
            \* disjunct stays present so the invariant is provable on the
            \* clean spec without conflating ratio and signal contributions.
        \/ SignalFires(lastOutcome, lastBlockerClass)

\* Safety: provider-opaque — the decision must not depend on any class
\* other than via SignalFires.  Stated as a frame condition: two states
\* with the same (autoHandoff, cooldownElapsed, ratioGate) and the same
\* SignalFires outcome must yield the same decision.  Proved trivially
\* by the structure of ComputeDecision (no other class references).
\*
\* This invariant is intentionally weaker than a refinement check — TLC
\* explores the state space and finds counterexamples on the buggy spec
\* where a non-"overflow" class drives the signal half of the gate.
