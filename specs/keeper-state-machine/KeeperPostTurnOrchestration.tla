---- MODULE KeeperPostTurnOrchestration ----
\* Post-turn orchestration — wirein ordering + blocker stamp contract.
\*
\* RFC-0065 Phase 5.3 (B3).  Closes memory P5 OPEN item by giving
\* Stage 4 (Post-Turn) explicit TLA+ coverage for the first time.
\*
\* Scope: models the post-turn sequence in keeper_post_turn.ml
\* (apply_post_turn_lifecycle_with_resilience_handles):
\*
\*   turn_ended
\*     → compaction_decision         ∈ {Applied, Blocked, Skipped}
\*     → blocker_info_stamped        ∈ {None, Some(klass)}
\*     → rollover_decision           (delegates to KeeperRolloverDecision)
\*     → wirein_autonomous (A5)
\*     → wirein_resilience (A6)
\*     → wirein_tool_emission (K4b)
\*     → wirein_multimodal (K1)
\*     → lineage_appended            (when rollover_decision = Go)
\*     → checkpoint_persisted
\*
\* This spec is ORTHOGONAL to its sibling Phase 5 specs:
\*   - KeeperCascadeAttemptFSM.tla  (B1, RFC-0065 Phase 5.1) — cascade FSM
\*   - KeeperToolSurface.tla        (B2, RFC-0065 Phase 5.2) — tool surface pipeline
\*   - KeeperRolloverDecision.tla   (Phase 4)                — rollover gate (this spec consumes its outcome class)
\*
\* OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping.  Cited by `path.ml:<symbol>` anchors (the form
\* scripts/lint/spec-line-refs.sh resolves via grep, not line number) —
\* iter 64 N-2.a convention.  The keeper_post_turn.ml refs were still
\* roughly accurate (keeper_post_turn.ml is ~920 LOC, hasn't grown much)
\* but switched to symbol anchors preventively; the old
\* keeper_unified_turn.ml line anchor had drifted (that file is ~3k LOC —
\* the current_turn_blocker_info stamp moved while the ref-decl stayed
\* near the turn-loop head).  See
\* docs/tla-audit/kpto-r10-post-turn-lineref-symbol-anchor-2026-05-12.md

\* Provider opacity (G3 acceptance gate):
\*   blocker_klass is modeled as an abstract symbol set ({"none",
\*   "sdk_token_budget_exceeded", "completion_contract_violation",
\*   "other"}).  None of the symbols name a provider, model, or vendor.
\*
\* Bug Model (per project's TLA+ Bug Model convention):
\*   Clean cfg: invariants WireinOrderPinned, BlockerStampedBeforeRollover,
\*              CheckpointPersistedAfterWirein, LineageAppendedOnRolloverGo
\*              must hold.
\*   Buggy cfg: SpecBuggy admits one of four BugActions —
\*     - BugWireinOutOfOrder      : A6 fires before A5
\*     - BugStampGap              : detail present but klass = none (the
\*                                  historical 4/14 keepers case — Track A
\*                                  closed the *rollover-fire* half;
\*                                  this catches the *producer* half)
\*     - BugCheckpointBeforeWirein: persist fires before A5–K1 mutate working_context
\*     - BugLineageAfterCheckpoint: lineage append after checkpoint persist
\*   At least one invariant MUST be violated.

CONSTANTS
    MaxSteps             \* upper bound on action count for bounded checking

\* Abstract klass alphabet.  Pinned in the spec (not parameterized via
\* CONSTANTS) so the OCaml ↔ TLA+ correspondence harness can grep the
\* literal set.  "none" is the sentinel emitted when no blocker class
\* was stamped; "sdk_token_budget_exceeded" is the single overflow-
\* relevant klass that Track A's blocker_class_indicates_overflow
\* returns true for.  The other two are representative non-overflow
\* klasses included to keep BlockerStampedBeforeRollover non-vacuous
\* without bloating the state space with all 26 OCaml variants.

\* The canonical wirein order is pinned at lib/keeper/keeper_post_turn.ml:apply_post_turn_lifecycle_with_resilience_handles — the apply_*_wirein chain (apply_autonomous_wirein → apply_resilience_wirein → apply_tool_emission_wirein → apply_multimodal_wirein) at its tail.
\* Reordering this constant is itself a regression — the spec must
\* observe THIS order, not a configurable one.

\* Stamp the blocker info.  Clean version: detail and klass are

\* BugAction #2: blocker_info detail is stamped but klass remains
\* "none".  This is the historical 4/14 keepers case: dashboard /
\* Prometheus sees the text but the typed enum is null, so downstream
\* gates (Track A's blocker_class_indicates_overflow) never fire.

\* I1: every prefix of wirein_order matches the canonical sequence.

WireinOrderPinned ==
    \A i \in 1..Len(wirein_order):
        wirein_order[i] = CanonicalWireinOrder[i]

\* I2: when the rollover fires (decision = "go"), blocker_klass must
\* have been stamped with a non-"none" value.  Closes the producer
\* half of the stamp gap (Track A PR #14613 closed the consumer half).
BlockerStampedBeforeRollover ==
    rollover_decision = "go" => blocker_klass /= "none"

\* I3: the checkpoint, once persisted, must follow the full A5–K1
\* wirein sequence.  Models the "persist depends on working_context
\* mutations from all wireins" guarantee.
CheckpointPersistedAfterWirein ==
    checkpoint_persisted => wirein_order = CanonicalWireinOrder

\* I4: when rollover decision = "go", lineage append fires BEFORE
\* checkpoint persist (the handoff record must be present in the
\* lineage trail before the checkpoint freezes state).
LineageAppendedOnRolloverGo ==
