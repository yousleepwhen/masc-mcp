\* TurnPhaseSet: phase membership type.
\*
\* R-B-1.a (iter 28, 2026-05-12): `routing` and `exhausted` added to close
\* the spec drift identified by `audit-tla-annotation-drift.sh`.  OCaml has
\* carried these since PR #14395 (Turn_routing active + Turn_exhausted
\* terminal).  This commit extends the type widening only; per-action
\* transition modeling (e.g. RoutingStart, RoutingExhausted, retry pumps
\* through routing) is intentionally deferred — see B-2 follow-up audit
\* (`docs/tla-audit/ktc-b1-turn-phase-spec-gap-2026-05-12.md`).
\*
\* The wider set keeps TypeOK total (every OCaml turn_phase is now
\* spec-typable) without altering the reachable state graph: Init pins
\* `turn_phase = "idle"` and no existing action transitions into routing
\* or exhausted, so TLC clean+buggy state counts are unchanged.  The
\* cross-axis invariants (SelectingRequiresToolPolicy etc.) are
\* conditional on specific phase membership and are not affected.
