---- MODULE KeeperToolSurface ----
\* Tool surface pipeline — provider-opaque set transformations.
\*
\* RFC-0065 Phase 5.2 (B2).
\*
\* Scope: models the 11-step compute_tool_surface pipeline as ordered
\* set transformations over an abstract universe of tool atoms.
\* This spec is ORTHOGONAL to the four existing keeper specs:
\*
\*   - KeeperStateMachine.tla         (keeper lifecycle)
\*   - KeeperCascadeRouting.tla       (cascade item/group routing)
\*   - KeeperCascadeAttemptFSM.tla    (RFC-0065 B1 — cascade attempt FSM)
\*   - KeeperRolloverDecision.tla     (rollover gate, RFC-0065 Phase 4)
\*
\* B2 covers what those do not: the surface-construction pipeline
\* invariants (validate gate, last-turn safety monotonicity, fallback
\* floor conditioning, max-tools cap with required preservation).
\*
\* OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping.  All refs use the lint-checkable [path.ml:symbol]
\* form (verified by scripts/lint/spec-line-refs.sh — symbol must resolve in
\* the file), not line number — iter 64 N-2.a convention; the previous
\* "keeper_run_tools.ml:NNN" anchors (≈16 of them, lines 794-1011) had drifted
\* as the file grew to ~1.7k LOC. The pipeline-stage detail lives in the
\* "semantic" column, the machine-checkable anchor in "OCaml anchor".
\* See docs/tla-audit/kts-r9-tool-surface-lineref-symbol-anchor-2026-05-12.md

\*
\* Provider opacity (G3 acceptance gate):
\*   The Tools universe is an abstract set of atoms ("t1", "t2", …) only.
\*   AlwaysAffordanceless is an opaque subset modeling tools that the
\*   validate_allow_list pipeline excludes from the affordanced surface
\*   (mirrors the OCaml missing_required_tool_names carve-out).  No
\*   literal tool name (e.g. "read_file", "bash") appears in this spec.
\*
\* Bug Model (per project's TLA+ Bug Model convention):
\*   Clean cfg: invariants RequiredSubsetEmitted, LastTurnSafeMonotone,
\*              FallbackFloorOnlyWhenEmpty, MaxToolsCap must hold.
\*   Buggy cfg: SpecBuggy admits one of four BugActions —
\*     - BugRequiredEscapesValidate : validate_allow_list bypass
\*     - BugLastTurnSafeAdds        : last-turn-safe filter as union
\*     - BugFallbackFloorAlwaysOn   : floor fires unconditionally
\*     - BugMaxToolsDropsRequired   : truncation drops required tools
\*   At least one safety invariant MUST be violated under SpecBuggy.

\* ── Helper: truncation preserving required tools ────────

\* The OCaml truncation (compute_tool_surface max_tools-truncation step (essential / non_essential split)) splits all_allowed
\* into "essential" (required + always-include) and "non-essential",
\* keeps essentials, then takes the first (cap - |essential|) of the
\* non-essentials.  Abstracted here as: any subset T of S with size
\* ≤ MaxToolsPerTurn that contains the required-and-affordanced subset.

\* ── Actions (clean) ─────────────────────────────────────

\* ComputePipeline: non-deterministically pick the turn inputs
\* (required, pre_floor, is_last_turn) and the stage-specific knobs
\* (floor injection, last-turn-safe whitelist, passive drop set),
\* then run the clean pipeline atomically.  Mirrors compute_tool_surface:
\*
\*   pre_floor →
\*     floor (fires only when pre_floor is empty) →
\*     last_turn_safe (intersect, only when is_last_turn) →

\* ── Bug actions (each models a class of regression) ─────

\* BugAction #1: validate_allow_list bypass — required tools that are

\* validate_allow_list from the overlay compose path.

\* I1: required tools must be preserved through to emitted, unless the

RequiredSubsetEmitted ==

        \/ (required \cap AlwaysAffordanceless) /= {}

\* I2: last-turn-safe stage only *removes* tools — it is an intersect,
\* never a union.  Pinned by the implementation at
\* compute_tool_surface Intersect_with safe_last_turn_tools step (when is_last_turn) (Intersect_with).
LastTurnSafeMonotone ==
    phase = "computed" => after_last_turn_safe \subseteq after_floor

\* I3: fallback floor fires only when the upstream surface is empty.
\* Models the explicit conditional at compute_tool_surface fallback-floor conditional (sets tool_surface_fallback_used).
FallbackFloorOnlyWhenEmpty ==
    (phase = "computed" /\ floor_fired) => (pre_floor = {})

\* I4: truncation cap is honored AND required tools that survived
\* upstream are preserved.  Mirrors the essential/non-essential split
