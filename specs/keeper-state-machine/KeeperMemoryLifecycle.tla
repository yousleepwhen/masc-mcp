---- MODULE KeeperMemoryLifecycle ----
\* File-system-backed keeper memory lifecycle.
\*
\* Models the bounded transition rules for short/mid/long memory across:
\*   - note capture,
\*   - overflow compaction,
\*   - generation handoff.
\*
\* Safety goals:
\*   - every persisted note has provenance,
\*   - overflow/handoff do not silently drop retained notes,
\*   - handoff clears stale short-term notes,
\*   - each tier stays within its configured bound.
\*
\* OCaml <-> TLA+ mapping (see #8642 family).  Cited by symbol name, not
\* line number — iter 64 N-2.a convention; the previous keeper_memory_policy.ml
\* line-number anchors had drifted +46 (the horizon constants are now
\* near the top of keeper_memory_policy.ml; see the kml-r8 memo below).
\* See docs/tla-audit/kml-r8-memory-lifecycle-lineref-drift-2026-05-12.md
\*
\*   spec variable    | OCaml field / source                              | location
\*   -----------------+--------------------------------------------------+--------
\*   short_mem        | rows with horizon = "short_term"                 | lib/keeper/keeper_memory_policy.ml — `short_term_horizon`
\*   mid_mem          | rows with horizon = "mid_term"                   | lib/keeper/keeper_memory_policy.ml — `mid_term_horizon`
\*   long_mem         | rows with horizon = "long_term"                  | lib/keeper/keeper_memory_policy.ml — `long_term_horizon`
\*   open_short       | unresolved short-term notes (open_question kind) | lib/keeper/keeper_memory_bank.ml
\*   provenanced      | rows with non-empty trace_id / source            | lib/keeper/keeper_memory_bank.ml
\*   generation       | snapshot.generation field                        | snapshot record
\*   overflowed       | derived: short_mem cardinality > MaxShort        | runtime check
\*
\* Tier vocabulary (string-typed, intentionally not a variant today) —
\* the horizon string constants in lib/keeper/keeper_memory_policy.ml:
\*     `let short_term_horizon = "short_term"`
\*     `let mid_term_horizon   = "mid_term"`
\*     `let long_term_horizon  = "long_term"`
\*
\* Producer (kind -> tier classification):
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_memory_policy.ml:memory_horizon_of_kind_opt  (strict)
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_memory_bank.ml:memory_horizon_of_kind_exn  (strict write wrapper)
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_memory_policy.ml:memory_horizon_of_json_opt  (JSON variant)
\*
\* Persistence / promotion sites:
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_memory_bank.ml:append_memory_notes_from_reply   — writes via memory_horizon_of_kind_exn
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_memory_recall.ml:read_recent_memory_texts_result  — recall path, same horizon fn
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_compact_policy.ml    overflow + handoff scheduling
\*   lib/keeper/keeper_compact_audit.ml     ledger trail (provenance source)
\*
\* Resolved producer drift:
\*   Unknown memory kinds now fail through the strict producer path instead of
\*   silently routing to mid_term_horizon. The spec invariants
\*   (ProvenanceRequired, RecoveryBounded, NoSilentLoss) still hold regardless
\*   of which valid tier a note lands in.
\*
\* Bug Model (BuggyCompactOverflow already in this spec):
\*   Clean cfg : NoSilentLoss holds (lost_notes = {}).
\*   Buggy cfg : compaction trims short tier WITHOUT promoting to mid;
\*               dropped notes accumulate in lost_notes -- NoSilentLoss
\*               MUST be violated.
\*
\* Adding new tiers / horizons:
\*   - new horizon constant -> spec needs a new tier variable + cap + invariant
\*   - new kind keyword     -> only producer side (memory_horizon_of_kind);
\*                             does NOT require spec update unless it lands
\*                             in a new tier
\*
\* Out-of-scope (intentionally not modelled here):
\*   - reward-model evaluation (lib/keeper/keeper_memory.ml include chain)
\*   - recall scoring (keeper_memory_recall.ml -- separate retrieval axis)
\*   - keeper-runtime compaction trigger thresholds (keeper_compact_policy.ml)
\*     this spec uses generic MaxShort/MaxMid/MaxLong constants instead
