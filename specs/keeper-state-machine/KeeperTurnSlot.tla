---- MODULE KeeperTurnSlot ----
\* KeeperTurnSlot -- #12888 productive-slot lifecycle contract.
\*
\* This is the formal target for the 174s <-> 600s slot leak class:
\* once degraded retry routing begins, the outer turn slot must already be
\* released. A retry may later reacquire a fresh productive slot, but it must
\* not keep the same acquisition across the retry phase.
\*
\* OCaml <-> TLA+ mapping (cited by symbol name, not line number -- iter 64
\* N-2.a convention):

\*   productive_elapsed         | the [current_turn_phase_elapsed_ms ()] closure
\*                              | inside keeper_unified_turn.ml's turn loop
\*   RetryScheduled             | the [Degraded_retry_allowed _] branch of
\*                              | keeper_turn_cascade_budget.ml's classifier
\*   ProductivePhaseExhausted   | the [Degraded_retry_slot_phase_exhausted _]
\*                              | branch of the same classifier
\*   release_at_phase           | cascade_rotation_attempt.slot_release_at_phase
\*                              | (keeper_execution_receipt.ml)
\*
\* Alphabet projection (spec scope).  The runtime's slot-release alphabet is
\* [type slot_release_phase] in keeper_execution_receipt.ml -- four non-None
\* constructors: Retry_setup_failed, Retry_scheduled, Retry_budget_exhausted,
\* Productive_phase_exhausted (plus the [option] None when no rotation
\* occurred).  ReleasePhaseSet below models a PROJECTION sufficient for the
\* #12888 leak class: it keeps "retry_scheduled" and "productive_phase_exhausted"
\* (the two slot-release outcomes the leak invariant cares about), drops
\* "retry_setup_failed" / "retry_budget_exhausted" (other terminal rotation
\* outcomes -- they also release the slot, but are not on the leak path this
\* spec pins), and adds two spec-internal markers: "none" (<-> the [option]
\* None / no rotation) and "finish" (a clean productive-phase finish releases
\* the slot; the runtime records no [slot_release_phase] for that case, since
\* [slot_release_at_phase] lives on [cascade_rotation_attempt], which only
\* exists for degraded retries).  So ReleasePhaseSet is not a 1:1 image of
\* [slot_release_phase]; it is the leak-relevant projection plus the
\* no-rotation / clean-finish endpoints the model needs to be closed.
\*
\* The current runtime mitigation (#13120) rejects late rotation once the
\* productive phase is exhausted; #13272 exposes the release/phase telemetry.
\* This spec pins the stricter #12888 target invariant so future two-tier
\* admission work has a model-level acceptance check.
