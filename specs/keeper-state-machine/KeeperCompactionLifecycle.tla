---- MODULE KeeperCompactionLifecycle ----
\* Keeper-facing compaction lifecycle projection.
\*
\* This spec models the runtime truth that spans:
\*   - parent phase derivation from overflow/compaction conditions,
\*   - per-turn retry posture preserved across overflow recovery,
\*   - registry compaction_stage updates.
\*
\* It is intentionally a projection, not a full copy of post-turn policy.
\* The runtime does not expose a compaction retry counter; only the
\* boolean retry-exhausted latch is modeled here.
\*
\* OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping (see also #8642 family — KeeperContextLifecycle,
\* KeeperCoreTriad, KeeperGenerationLineage, KeeperReconcileLiveness):
\*
\*   spec phase  | OCaml Keeper_state_machine.phase  | source of truth
\*   ------------+-----------------------------------+----------------
\*   "Running"   | Running                           | keeper_state_machine.ml — type phase, the `Running` constructor
\*   "Overflowed"| Overflowed                        | keeper_state_machine.ml — type phase, the `Overflowed` constructor
\*   "Compacting"| Compacting                        | keeper_state_machine.ml — type phase, the `Compacting` constructor
\*   "Paused"    | Paused                            | keeper_state_machine.ml — type phase, the `Paused` constructor
\*   (cited by symbol, not line — iter 64 N-2.a; the `keeper_state_machine.ml:N`
\*    anchors were accurate (top-of-file `type phase`) but converted for
\*    consistency in the iter 85 scattered-singles line-ref sweep)
\*
\* Out-of-scope OCaml phases (intentional projection — not modelled here):
\*   Offline, Failing, HandingOff, Draining, Crashed
\*
\* The 4-phase projection captures only the overflow/compaction recovery
\* loop. Other lifecycle transitions (boot/shutdown/handoff/crash) live in
\* sibling specs (e.g. KeeperContextLifecycle for boot/handoff/draining,
\* KeeperCircuitBreaker for crash/failing).
\*
\* Out-of-scope subsidiary variants (issue #8957 — also intentional
\* projection, but flagged so a future runtime change cannot silently
\* bypass TLC by visiting an unmodelled value):

\*
\* If a future change makes one of the excluded variants reachable inside
\* the compaction lifecycle, this spec MUST be updated (extend the matching
\* *Set, update TypeOK, re-verify the existing invariants). See #8957 for
\* the maintenance contract.
\*
\* compaction_stage variant ↔ OCaml: TLA models {accumulating, compacting,
\* done}; OCaml runtime uses the same labels in
\* lib/keeper/keeper_registry.ml + lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml
\* (search "compaction_stage").
\*
\* retry_exhausted boolean ↔ OCaml: latched by Compact_retry_exhausted
\* event; cleared by Compaction_completed (lib/keeper/keeper_state_machine.ml).
