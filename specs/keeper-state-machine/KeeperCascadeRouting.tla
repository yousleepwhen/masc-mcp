---- MODULE KeeperCascadeRouting ----
(* RFC-0041: Cascade Routing Architecture — Group/Item Hierarchy.

   Models the L1 Proactive Routing layer: per-turn health-aware item
   selection, group fallback chain, and keeper isolation.

   OCaml ↔ TLA+ mapping:

   Scope: this spec models item-level health transitions and group
   fallback chains ONLY.  It is orthogonal to KeeperCascadeLifecycle.tla
   (turn-level states: idle/selecting/trying/done/exhausted) and
   CascadeAttemptLiveness.tla (per-attempt streaming FSM).

   Design Anchors (RFC-0041 §3):
   1. cascade 때문에 Keeper 움직임을 끊기게 하면 안 됨
   2. 한 Keeper의 cascade가 다른 Keeper를 막지 않음
   3. 텔레메트리 정보가 분명하게 수집될 것
   4. cascade는 group과 item을 소유함
   5. item은 설정/전략에 따라 선택되거나 fallback 됨
   6. group 낸부 순회가 안 된다면 다른 group으로 시도할 수 있음

(* I7: Per-keeper isolation — partial truth.
   --------------------------------------------------------------
   In this spec, [item_health] and [consecutive_failures] are keyed by
   <<keeper, item>>, so one keeper's failure history on item i does not
   poison another keeper's view of the same item.  At this layer the
   isolation property *is* structural: TLC cannot construct a transition
   that violates it because the variable typing forbids it.

   Production reality (lib/cascade/cascade_health_tracker.ml) is more
   nuanced: that module tracks a separate axis of "cooldown" state keyed
   by [provider_key] rather than <<keeper, item>>, so two keepers using
   the same provider share the cooldown state.  This is a deliberate
   design choice in production (one provider's transient 429 should
   affect everyone), not a bug.  But it means a strict literal reading
   of "per-keeper isolation" as a project-wide invariant would be false.

   Removed the `PerKeeperIsolation == TRUE` placeholder that previously
   sat here.  A trivially-true definition is misleading because it
   suggests an invariant strong enough to enforce keeper-vs-keeper
   isolation across all axes — including production's cooldown axis —
   when in fact this spec deliberately abstracts cooldown away.

   See: docs/tla-audit/kcr-c2-health-state-representation-gap-2026-05-12.md
   for the full audit and RFC-C-2 candidates.

(* ── Error variant extension (RFC-0057 Phase 3) ────────────

   The cascade_attempt_fsm.ml string classifier anti-pattern
   (13 contains_substring_ci calls) is replaced by typed variants.
   This spec section documents the intended TLA+ model for the
   extended error surface.

   New error kinds (previously reconstructed from message strings):

   - CliWrappedHardQuota   : CLI exit with hard quota (e.g. 403)
   - CliWrappedMaxTurns    : CLI exit with max-turns exceeded
   - CliWrappedResumable   : CLI exit with resumable session signal
   - PermissionDenied      : 401/403 from API or CLI
   - ModelNotFound         : 404 from API or CLI

   These extend the http_error type that Call_err carries.
