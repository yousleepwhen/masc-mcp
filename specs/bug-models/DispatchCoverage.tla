---- MODULE DispatchCoverage ----
\* Bug Model: FSM Event Dispatch Coverage for Data-Layer Clearing Actions.
\*
\* Bug class: "Code clears a blocking condition at the data layer but
\* forgets to dispatch the corresponding FSM event."
\*
\* Headline live instance: keeper_context_runtime.ml clears the data-layer
\* compaction_active flag and MUST dispatch Compaction_completed to the
\* FSM in the same step (line 174). If the dispatch is omitted,
\* derive_phase keeps the keeper in Compacting forever even though the
\* flag is cleared. Same shape applies to handoff_active +
\* Handoff_completed (line 190), turn-failure counter + Turn_succeeded
\* (keeper_keepalive.ml:947 inside maybe_recover_from_failing at :935),
\* and the guardrail measurement carried by Context_measured (line 807).
\*
\* Historical instance (Bug #1, #6801): maybe_recover_from_failing()
\* used to call Keeper_manual_reconcile.clear (data) without dispatching
\* Manual_reconcile_cleared. The Keeper_manual_reconcile mechanism has
\* been removed from the runtime (gravestone comment at
\* keeper_status_detail.ml:118), so this spec drops "reconcile" from
\* the modeled Blockers set and retains only the 4 live blockers
\* (turn / compact / handoff / guardrail). See #9032.
\*
\* This spec models 4 blocking conditions from the keeper FSM
\* (keeper_state_machine.ml). Each has a "data layer" boolean and an
\* "FSM condition" boolean. A clearing action MUST set both to FALSE
\* atomically (within 1 step). The buggy variant omits the FSM dispatch.

\*
\* ── Abstraction ──
\* Each blocking condition is modeled as a pair: (data_blocked, fsm_blocked).
\* Setting a blocker sets both to TRUE. A correct clear sets both to FALSE.
\* A buggy clear sets data_blocked=FALSE but leaves fsm_blocked=TRUE.
\* derive_phase uses fsm_blocked, so the keeper stays stuck.

CONSTANTS
    Blockers  \* Set of blocker names, e.g. {"reconcile", "turn", "compact", "handoff", "guardrail"}

VARIABLES
    data_blocked,   \* [Blockers -> BOOLEAN] : data-layer state
    fsm_blocked,    \* [Blockers -> BOOLEAN] : FSM conditions record
    phase           \* "running" | "failing" : simplified derive_phase output

TypeOK ==
    /\ data_blocked \in [Blockers -> BOOLEAN]

    /\ phase \in {"running", "failing"}

\* ── Derived phase (mirrors derive_phase in keeper_state_machine.ml) ──
\* If ANY fsm_blocked condition is TRUE, phase is "failing".
\* Otherwise phase is "running".

DerivePhase(fsm) ==
    IF \E b \in Blockers : fsm[b] = TRUE
    THEN "failing"
    ELSE "running"

\* ── Init ──

Init ==
    /\ data_blocked = [b \in Blockers |-> FALSE]
    /\ fsm_blocked  = [b \in Blockers |-> FALSE]
    /\ phase = "running"

\* ── Actions ──

\* Set a blocker: both data and FSM layers agree.
SetBlocker(b) ==
    /\ data_blocked[b] = FALSE
    /\ data_blocked' = [data_blocked EXCEPT ![b] = TRUE]
    /\ fsm_blocked'  = [fsm_blocked  EXCEPT ![b] = TRUE]
    /\ phase' = DerivePhase(fsm_blocked')

\* Correct clear: clears BOTH data and FSM in one step.
CorrectClear(b) ==
    /\ data_blocked[b] = TRUE
    /\ data_blocked' = [data_blocked EXCEPT ![b] = FALSE]

\* ── Safety Invariants ──

\* CORE INVARIANT: If data says "not blocked" then FSM must also say
\* "not blocked". This is the dispatch coverage contract.
\* Violation means: data was cleared but FSM event was not dispatched.

DataFsmConsistent ==
    \A b \in Blockers :
        data_blocked[b] = FALSE => fsm_blocked[b] = FALSE

\* DERIVED INVARIANT: Phase must agree with FSM conditions.
\* (This is a consistency check on DerivePhase.)

PhaseConsistent ==
    phase = DerivePhase(fsm_blocked)

\* STUCK DETECTION: A keeper is "stuck in Failing" if phase="failing"
\* but ALL data blockers are cleared. This is the observable symptom
\* of the bug class.

NeverStuckFailing ==
    (phase = "failing") =>
        (\E b \in Blockers : data_blocked[b] = TRUE)

\* ── Bug Model: one blocker omits FSM dispatch ──
\* The buggy clear sets data_blocked=FALSE but does NOT touch fsm_blocked.
\* Live instance the spec now guards: a refactor in
\* keeper_context_runtime.ml that clears the compaction_active or
\* handoff_active flag without dispatching the matching
\* Compaction_completed / Handoff_completed event. Same shape as the
\* historical reconcile bug (#6801) but applied to the 4 live blockers
\* still mapped above.

BuggyClear(b) ==
    /\ data_blocked[b] = TRUE
    /\ data_blocked' = [data_blocked EXCEPT ![b] = FALSE]
    /\ UNCHANGED fsm_blocked   \* BUG: forgot to dispatch FSM event
    /\ phase' = DerivePhase(fsm_blocked')
