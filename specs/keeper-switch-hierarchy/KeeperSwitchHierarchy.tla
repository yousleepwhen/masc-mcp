---- MODULE KeeperSwitchHierarchy ----
\* RFC-0107 Phase C.0 — Eio.Switch hierarchy model for keeper run_turn.
\*
\* Models the global Eio context (Eio_context.current_sw : Atomic.t) and
\* the proposed Option (2) "with_sw" atomic-swap wrap for run_turn body.
\*
\* Runtime truth being modelled:
\*   - On server startup, root_sw is set; current_sw := root_sw.
\*   - Two fiber roles run concurrently:
\*       * SERVER fibers (dashboard, board_dispatch, relation_materializer) —
\*         fork child work that MUST attach to root_sw
\*         (they outlive any single turn).
\*       * KEEPER fibers — execute run_turn. Inside run_turn, with_sw swaps
\*         current_sw := turn_sw, and resources created by keeper should
\*         attach to turn_sw (so they die when the turn ends).
\*   - Both roles read the *same global atomic* via get_switch_opt ().
\*
\* What this spec is FOR:
\*   - Invariant ServerResourcesOnRoot: every resource created by a SERVER
\*     fiber attaches to root_sw — never to turn_sw.
\*   - Invariant KeeperResourcesScoped: keeper resources created inside a
\*     turn attach to turn_sw, and after turn end either (a) the resource
\*     is released, or (b) the switch they attach to remains alive (impossible
\*     when turn_sw is closed → forces release).
\*
\* The *BUGGY* configuration (KeeperSwitchHierarchy-buggy.cfg) enables a
\* ServerForkDuringTurn action that lets a SERVER fiber read current_sw
\* *while it equals turn_sw*. The server resource then attaches to turn_sw
\* and survives past turn end → ServerResourcesOnRoot violated. This is the
\* concrete race that motivates Option (3) fiber-local or §2.1 root_sw_ref
\* mitigation (see RFC-0107-eio-context-switch-audit.md §5).
\*
\* This is the TLA+ Bug Model pattern (software-development.md §"TLA+ Bug
\* Model 패턴"): clean cfg must pass with no error; buggy cfg must violate
\* the invariant in a small number of steps.

\* Server forks a child fiber. By the §2.1 intent, it MUST attach to root_sw.
\* In the CLEAN model, server reads current_sw only when turn_phase = "idle"
\* (guarded by some external invariant, e.g. fiber-local fallback). This is
\* what Option (3) gives us automatically.

    /\ UNCHANGED << sw_state, current_sw, turn_phase, turns_used >>

\* Keeper enters run_turn: with_sw turn_sw (...). Atomic swap + open turn_sw.
KeeperStartTurn ==

    /\ turns_used < MaxTurns
    /\ turn_phase' = "in_turn"

    /\ UNCHANGED << turns_used, resources >>

\* Keeper forks inside turn. attaches to current_sw (= turn_sw under wrap).
KeeperFork ==
    /\ turn_phase = "in_turn"
    /\ Cardinality(resources) < 2 * MaxTurns * MaxResources
    /\ resources' = resources \cup
         {[id |-> NextResourceId, role |-> "keeper",
           attached |-> current_sw, released |-> FALSE]}
    /\ UNCHANGED << sw_state, current_sw, turn_phase, turns_used >>

\* Keeper exits run_turn: closes turn_sw, restores current_sw := root_sw.
\* Any resource attached to turn_sw is *forcibly* released (Eio.Switch
\* contract: resources cannot outlive switch). We model this by setting
\* released := TRUE for all turn_sw resources.

(* ── BUG action — race during turn ─────────────────────────────────── *)

\* SERVER fiber forks WHILE keeper is in turn. Reads current_sw = turn_sw,
\* attaches to turn_sw. Premature termination guaranteed when KeeperEndTurn
\* fires. This is the concrete §5 race scenario in the audit note.
