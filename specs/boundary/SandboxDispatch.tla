---- MODULE SandboxDispatch ----
\* Boundary spec for keeper sandbox dispatch routing.
\*
\* Runtime truth (lib/keeper/keeper_tools_oas.ml +
\* lib/keeper/agent_tool_command_runtime.ml):
\*
\*   - [meta_profile] is the keeper's declared sandbox preference
\*     (Local | Docker).
\*   - [in_playground] gates whether playground-host fallback is even a
\*     candidate route at the dispatch site.
\*   - [dispatched_via] records how the most recent typed Execute request was
\*     resolved: None (no dispatch yet), Host, DockerReuse (existing
\*     container), DockerColdstart (new container).
\*
\* The contract this spec proves:
\*   meta_profile = Docker => dispatched_via ∉ {None, Host} once a
\*   request resolves. PR #11594 (Execute dispatch SSOT) and
\*   PR #11610 (effective_sandbox_profile invariant) close the silent
\*   host-fallback path at the runtime; this spec proves the routing
\*   contract is enforceable.
\*
\* Why this is its own module (not a ToolCallContract.tla extension):
\*   ToolCallContract is the telemetry boundary contract; its outcome
\*   axis {none, text, tool_use, error} does not carry a "via" axis,
\*   so adding one would force every existing action's UNCHANGED
\*   clauses to grow and obscure the original intent. SandboxDispatch
\*   is the routing-layer contract, kept narrow on the variables that
\*   matter.
\*
\* Bug Model (memory: TLA+ Bug Model pattern):
\*   - Spec       (clean): all dispatches respect the profile contract.
\*   - SpecBuggy:  ExecuteHostFallback action lets a Docker-declared
\*     keeper resolve to Host. DockerImpliesDockerVia MUST flag it.
\*
\* Reference: issue #11611 part 2.

\* ── Invariants ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

\* I1: DockerImpliesDockerVia. When the keeper declares Docker profile
\* AND a request has already resolved (request_pending = FALSE), the
\* dispatch route MUST be one of {None (no dispatch yet), DockerReuse,
\* DockerColdstart}; never Host. This catches the silent host-fallback
\* class that PR #11594/#11610 root-fix series target.
\*
\* The "None" branch is permitted because the model starts in that
\* state and EffectiveResolve resets it; only resolutions where the
\* runtime actually chose a route are constrained.
DockerImpliesDockerVia ==
    (meta_profile = "Docker" /\ ~ request_pending) =>
        dispatched_via \in {"None", "DockerReuse", "DockerColdstart"}

\* ── Bug actions (used only by SpecBuggy) ──────────────────────────────────

\* B1: ExecuteHostFallback. The regression class: a Docker-declared
\* keeper hits a legacy host-fallback path in the typed Execute dispatch layer
\* and resolves the request via Host. This is the silent fallback that
\* makes Docker isolation a soft contract; the spec catches it as an
\* invariant violation in <=3 steps.
