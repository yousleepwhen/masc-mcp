--------------------------- MODULE CoordinationProduct ---------------------------
\* Advisory Goal x Task x Board x Reward orthogonal product.
\*
\* Mirrors:
\*
\* Advisory product spec only. There is no current OCaml
\* coordination_product module; keep this spec detached until a new
\* implementation owner is introduced.
\*
\* This model checks cross-axis safety only. Each axis can evolve
\* independently, but terminal goal/reward states require evidence from
\* another axis. The OCaml implementation reports violations in advisory mode
\* instead of blocking writes.
\*
\* Two-config pattern:
\*   CoordinationProduct.cfg       -- clean spec, invariants must hold
\*   CoordinationProduct-buggy.cfg -- buggy spec, invariants MUST be violated
